Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.1,"Dhrtarashtra asked of Sanjaya: O SANJAYA, what did my warrior sons and those of Pandu do when they were gathered at KURUKSHETRA, the field of religious activities? Tell me of those happenings."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.2,"Sanjaya explained: Now seeing that the army of the PANDAVAS was set up properly, the Price DURYODHANA called his teacher, DRONA, to his side and spoke these words:"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.3,"Behold O, Master, the mighty army of the sons of PANDU, led by the son of DRUPADA, your talented disciple."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.4,"Present here are the mighty archers, peers or friends, in warfare, of ARJUNA and BHIMA. Their names are: YUYUDHANA, VIRATA and DRUPADA, the great chariot-warrior. Other great warriors were also present on the battlefield: DHRSHTAKEUT, CHEKITANA and the brave and noble King of Kasi, KUNTIBHIJA and SAIBYA; these are among the great warriors. Other courageous and great chariot-warriors were: YUDHAMANYU, the brave UTTAMAUJA, SAUBHADRA, and the sons of DRAUPADI."

Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.8,"Your wise self, BHISMA, KARNA, KRIPA, the victorious in fight; ASVATTHAMA, VIKARNA and SAUMADATTI as well."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.9,"Duryodhana further said to Drona: Yet several other heroes and great men, well-trained in combat, armed with assorted powerful weapons and missiles, are ready to lay down their lives for me!"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.10,"Duryodhana explained with pride to Drona: Our army, led by BHISMA, is numerous and skilled. The army led by BHIMA, however, is weak and lacking in strength and power."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.11,"Duryodhana instructed his army: Now all of you quickly assume your proper positions for battle, your main goal being to protect and fight alongside BHISMA, your leader, by all means."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.12,"To bring joy to DURYODHANA?s heart, the great grandsire BHISMA, the oldest and most famous of the KAURAVAS, roared loudly like a lion (a battle-cry), and blew his conch to signal the army to advance towards the enemy."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.13,"Tremendous noise followed. Conches, kettle-drums, tabors, and trumpets and cowhorns blared across the battlefield."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.14,MADHAVA (Lord Krishna) and PANDAVA were seated in their magnificent chariote attached to white horses and they blew gracefully their divine conches.
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.15,The PANCHAJANYA (the name of one of the conches) was blown by HRISHIKESA (Lord Krishna). The conch named DEVADATTA was blown by DHANANJAYA (Arjuna).

Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.18,"Drupada and the sons of Draupadi, O Lord of the Earth, and the son of Subhadra, the mighty armed, blew their respective conches."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.19,The earth and sky was filled with the extremely loud and terrible noise of the PANDAVAS? bugles and voices which struck fear in the hearts of the KAURAVAS (the sons of Dhrtarashtra).
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.20,"Sanjaya said :Then, my king, seeing the KAURAVAS (the army of Dhrtarashtra), positioned and ready to begin fighting, ARJUNA, whose flag was that of HANUMAN, spoke the following words to SHRI KRISHNA, as he lifted his bow to fight the battle."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.21,"Arjuna said: In the midst of the two armies, place my chariot, O Achyuta, that I may behold those who stand here desirous of fighting and, on the eve of this battle, let me know with whom I must fight."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.22,"Place my chariot, O ACHYUTA (Lord Krishna) between the two armies so that I may see those who wish to fight for us and also to see who I have to fight against, in this war."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.23,I desire to see all of those great warrior kings who have gathered here to fight alongside the evil-minded DURYODHANA (son of Dhrtarashtra).
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.24,"Sanjaya continued:After being requested by GUDAKESA (Arjun), HRISHIKESA (Lord Krishna), placed ARJUN?s magnificent chariot between the armies. The chariot was now facing BHISMA, the Guru DRONA, and all the rulers of the earth; then Lord KRISHNA spoke to ARJUNA: ?O, PARTHA (Arjuna), see yourself all of the KAURAVAS assembled here on the battlefield today.?"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.25,"In front of Bhishma and Drona, and all the rulers of the earth, he said, O Partha, behold these Kurus gathered together."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.26,"ARJUNA, gazed upon the army and then saw in both armies, paternal uncles, grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, cousins, sons, grandsons, friends, fathers-in-law, and well-wishers. The son of KUNTI (Arjuna), after viewing all of those relatives and friends posted in their positions on the battlefield, became melancholy and filled with compassion (love) for his relatives, and spoke in a sad voice:"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.27,"(He saw) Fathers-in-law and friends also in both the armies. Then the son of Kunti, seeing all these kinsmen thus standing arrayed, spoke thus sorrowfully, filled with deep pity."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.28,"Arjuna said:O KRISHNA, seeing my kinsmen (relatives) standing before me to fight against me in this war, I find myself unable to move my body, and my mouth has become parched. He continued: I have no longer any control over my body; my hair stands on end. I cannot control my bow GANDIVA, and my skin burns all over."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.29,"My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body quivers and my hair stands on end."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.30,"I can no longer stand; my knees are weak; my mind is clouded and spinning in many directions, and, dear KRISHNA, I am seeing bad signs."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.31,"I cannot see any good in slaughtering and killing my friends and relatives in battle. O KRISHNA, I have no use nor desire for victory, empire or even materialistic pleasures."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.32,"O GOVINDA, (Krishna), what in the use of a kindgom, enjoyment or even life?"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.33,"Those whom we seek these pleasures from (the enjoyment of kingdom), are standing before us staking their lives and property, possessions which I have no desire for."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.34,"O Lord KRISHNA, I do not want to kill my teachers, uncles, friends, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law, and other relatives and well-wishers."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.35,Arjuna spoke to the Lord Madhusudhana (Lord Krishna): I could not slay (kill) my relatives even if I had to give my own life away. I could not slay them even for domination of the three worlds; how could I slay them for domination of this earth.
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.36,"O KRISHNA, why should we kill our own loved ones and kinsmen when no happiness or good can come out of so doing?"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.37,"Greed has clouded the minds and overpowered the intelligence of the sons of DHRTARASHTRA and so they feel no guilt, and fail to see the sins they are commiting by betraying friends and destroying their families. Arjuna continued: Why should we not realize, O KRISHNA, the wrong-doings and sins that the sons of DHRTARASATRA cannot see and realize, and save ourselves from committing these sins?"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.38,"Why should not we, who clearly see evil in the destruction of the family-units, learn to turn away from this sin, O Janardana?"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.39,"Arjuna explained: When one begins to destroy his own family, then his ancient, respected traditions, customs, moral values, principles, are destroyed as well. By the destruction of these, the whole family becomes evil and huge sins are committed."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.40,"O KRISHNA, with the growth of evil in a family, the family women, become impure and evil, and sinning with those of other castes would follow."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.41,"By the mixture of castes, families will breed more family destroyers; being deprived of food and water, their ancestors will also fall from heaven."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.42,"The everlasting traditions, customs and principles of a caste are destroyed when different castes join together and create mixed-blood generations. This leads to confusion of a caste?s customs."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.43,"It has been heard, O JANARDHANA (Krishna) that hell is the permanent home for those men whose families? religious practices have been broken and destroyed."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.44,"Moreover, it is a great shame, that knowing and understanding everything, we are still ready to commit such a great sin of killing our kinsmen, just because of greed for kingdom and pleasures."
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.45,"I think it would be better for me if the sons of DHRTARASHTRA slay me, with their weapons while I remain unarmed and unwilling to fight back"
Arjuna's Vishada Yoga,Chapter 1,Verse 1.46,"Sanjaya said:Having said this, ARJUNA, still extremely sad and confused sat on the seat of this chariot throwing away his bow and arrows."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.1,"Sanjay recounted:MADHUSUDANA (Lord Krishna) then spoke in his divine voice unto ARJUNA, who was terribly upset and overcome with grief and guilt at the thought of war he was about to enter into."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.2,"The Blessed Lord asked of Arjuna: Dear Arjuna, why have you been struck with fear, guilt and sorrow at this moment ?"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.3,"O Arjuna, be brave, be a bold, courageous man. Do not be a coward and a feeble person, it does not suit such a great warrior and killer of enemies as you !"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.4,"Arjuna asked the Lord:O Madhusudana (Lord Krishna), the killer of foes, tell me how I am to kill BHISMA and DRONA when they are both worthy of my worship ?"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.5,It is much better to live on a beggar?s earnings than to kill the great saints or Gurus. After killing them I will only enjoy material wealth and pleasure stained with their blood.
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.6,"The sons of DHRTARASHTA stand here before us as our opponents and enemies. It is difficult to say which is better: whether they should destroy us or whether we should conquer the. If we choose to slay them, how can we possibly care to live on ?"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.7,"Please, Dear Lord, I am your disciple, kindly guide and instruct me, for I have taken refuge and shelter in you.I am confused as to my duties and what is good for me. I beg you to give me knowledge, wisdom and a clear, logical mind."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.8,"I cannot find any cure for the great great grief I suffer, O KRISHNA, even though by winning this war, I would achieve great power and rule over the earth and the heavens."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.9,"Sanjaya said:Dear Dhrtarashtra, my great king, after addressing HRISHIKESHA (Lord of the senses). GUDUKESHA (conqueror of sleep), and PARAMTAPAH (destroyer of all enemies), ARJUN spoke clearly to the great Lord KRISHNA in a determined and assured voice that he would not fight, and then became silent."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.10,"?O ARJUNA,? HRISHIKESA spoke smilingly, as ARJUNA stood between the two armies:"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.11,"ARJUNA, you show your grief and compassion for those who do not deserve your grief, compassion or sympathy. Although your words are filled with wisdom, you must remember, the wise men never grieve for the living or the dead.?"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.12,"ARJUNA?, always remember, there has never been a time when you or any of the great warriors present here, were not alive or non-existent, nor will we all, at any time, cease to exist and live on in the future."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.13,"Lord Krishna continued:Dear ARJUNA, the wise never get confused by the fact that the ATMA or Soul goes through the stages of childhood, youth and old age along with the body. When one body ceases to function, the soul passes on to another body. The cycle is then repeated once more."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.14,"The Blessed Lord continued: son of KUNTI (Arjuna), when the senses come in contact with their sensual objects, feelings of heat, cold, pain and pleasure. These feelings last only for a short time; they will come and go. Bear them patiently dear ARJUNA."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.15,"Only he who is not affected by these senses and sensual objects becomes immortal, for he is considered the best of men because he is well balanced in pain and pleasure."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.16,"The Blessed Lord stated:The unreal does not exist and the real always exists. Those with peaceful, pure and wise minds, know the truth about both the real and unreal."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.17,"He who is completely indestructible, present everywhere in the universe, and is imperishable, regard Him as God O ARJUNA."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.18,"The Blessed Lord explained: O ARJUNA, only the body can be destroyed; but the soul is indestructible, permanent and immortal. Therefore ARJUNA, pick up your weapons and fight!"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.19,"O ARJUNA, he who thinks of the Soul as a killer and he who thinks that Soul can be killed, is ignorant, because the Soul can never be killed nor can it kill anyone or anything."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.20,"The Blessed Lord said: Dear ARJUNA, the ATMAN or Soul can neither be born nor can it die. It is forever immortal, eternal and ancient. The Soul in a body does not die when the body itself perishes and ceases to exist. The Soul always lives on."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.21,"ARJUNA, he who knows the Soul to be eternal, indestructible, permanent unborn, and endless, that person can neither kill nor be killed."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.22,"The Blessed Lord said: Just as a person gets rid of old clothing and replaces the old clothing with new ones, similarly, the soul changes from one body to a new body when its body has become old worn out and has stopped functioning."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.23,"The Soul cannot be cut by weapons, burnt by fire, absorbed by air, nor can water wet the Soul."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.24,"The Soul is eternal, everlasting. It cannot be destroyed, broken or burnt; it cannot become wet nor become dried. The Soul is the most stable thing in the universe, it is immovable and present throughout the universe."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.25,"The Soul cannot be seen, With this mind, dear changed by any means. With this mind, dear ARJUNA, one should never grieve."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.26,"Even if you incorrectly believe. O ARJUNA, that the Soul is constantly taking birth and dying, you should still not become upset and filled with grief and sadness."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.27,"Dear ARJUNA, knowing the fact that anything that takes birth will eventually die, it seems pointless to grieve over someone?s death, especially if you knew that the death had to take place anyway."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.28,"ARJUNA, all beings are unseen before birth, are seen after birth and during their lives; again, however, all beings are unseen after death. So what cause is there to worry?"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.29,"Few look upon ?the Soul? with curiosity. Some talk and hear of ?the Soul? with curiosity and enchantment, but in the end, there is nobody who can really understand and comprehend ?the Soul.?"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.30,"ARJUNA, although the body can be slain, the Soul cannot. The Soul of a being lives on forever, therefor it is not necessary to grieve over anybody?s death because the most important part of them never dies at all, and that is, their Souls."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.31,"Looking upon your duty, ARJUNA, as a Kshatriya (warrior), you should never be afraid, but be courageous, because there is nothing better for a Kshatriya than to fight in a righteous war."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.32,"Dear ARJUNA, you should consider yourself a very lucky warrior to fight in a war where for the victor, the prize is entrance to the gates of heaven."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.33,"By not fighting this war, O ARJUNA, you are committing a sin because you fail to perform your duty as a warrior and you also will lose your honour."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.34,"People will talk and look upon you, O ARJUNA, with disrespect. There is only one thing worse than death itself, and that is, disrespect for a respectable man."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.35,"O ARJUNA, your high esteem and reputation will become ruined if you do not fight this battle. The mighty warriors will consider you lower than them and will believe that you did not fight the battle because you feared the opponent."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.36,"You will experience tremendous pain when your enemies laugh at your lack of strength and courage and say many shameful and humiliating things about you, O ARJUNA."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.37,"O ARJUNA, if you fight this battle, think of how it shall benefit you. If you die during battle, you will go to heaven and be in eternal peace. If you shall be victorious O ARJUNA, you will be the ruler of this Kingdom. O ARJUNA, stand up, take courage, and fight!"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.38,"The Blessed Lord spoke unto Arjuna: O ARJUNA, by considering victory and defeat, pleasure and pain, gain and loss with indifference, you will not commit any sin."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.39,"O ARJUNA, you already have been presented knowledge. Now you must put this knowledge to practical use O ARJUNA, with selfless KARMYOGA, O ARJUNA, by doing your duty and leaving the results of your actions to the Lord, you will break the bonds of KARMA."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.40,"When one practises Yoga, there is no fear of destruction; the person does not suffer a loss of honest effort in whatever he or she attempts. Even by practising a little bit of Yoga, one is protected from great fear ( of death or danger). Peace of mind is slowly obtained."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.41,"Those with a firm mind, O ARJUNA, are decisive about everything. Those whose minds are infirm are not decisive in their actions and their intellect wanders in many directions."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.42,"O ARJUNA, unwise people who think of nothing but material desires and pleasures, and who believe in the Vedas as well, think that heaven means the absolute end of oneself."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.43,"Full of desires, having heaven as their goal, they utter flowery words, which promise new birth as the reward of their actions, and prescribe various specific actions for the attainment of pleasure and Lordship."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.44,"For, those who cling to joy and Lordship, whose minds are drawn away by such teaching, are neither determinate and resolute nor are they fit for steady meditation and SAMADHI."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.45,"The Blessed Lord spoke: The Vedas deal mainly with the three Gunas (qualities and nature). One of these is known as the material portion of life in the world. You must overcome all of these Gunas, O ARJUNA. Get rid of all you doubts. Free yourself of all frustrations and grief and devote mind and soul to God. This is true peace and happiness."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.46,"O ARJUNA, to an enlightened soul, the Vedas are only as useful as a tank of water during a flood."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.47,"O ARJUNA, always remember what I am about to say to you for it is the law of KARMA, a law that one should always obey in life should he/she ever feel resentment, frustration, anxiety, or grief:You have the right only to perform your actions, duties and responsibilities in life; however, the results of these actions should not concern you at all. You should not even desire results for your actions because the results are simply not in your hands, but in the hands of the Lord. Neither should you lean towards inaction. (This is the most important shloka describing Karmyoga.)"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.48,"The Divine Lord said: O ARJUNA, perform all your actions with an even mind. In other words, do not feel overjoyed at the successes in your life and do not allow yourself to feel overcome with grief because of any failures you may encounter on life. Rid yourself of any attachments to material things and always remember that the results of your actions is in the Lord?s hands. If you react the same way, regardless of the result of your actions, you are performing what is known as KARMYOGA."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.49,"The Blessed Lord said unto ARJUNA:When actions are performed by a person for any selfish motive or gain, that person shall always suffer and remain disappointed in life. Those, however, who practice KARMYOGA or the Yoga of even-mindedness, are free from any worries or disappointments for they do not care for the results of their actions and duties."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.50,"That person who devotes himself to a life of KARMYOGA with no selfish motives in mind does not become hungry for power, nor does he become attached to any of the bad and disgusting things in life. Therefore, O ARJUNA, always strive to achieve selfless KARMYOGA, for this is the path of perfection in life."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.51,"Those individuals who have devoted their lives to the practice of KARMYOGA, they not only free themselves of the worries that accompany anticipation of results after performing certain actions, but also free themselves of all sins and achieve the supreme state of everlasting peace and happiness."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.52,"When you finally reach the state where your mind is free from all attachments and pleasures in life, your intellect will clear and will give you the ability to think logically, and wisely, whenever you need to."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.53,"Your intellect, O ARJUNA, will then allow you to distinguish between the real and the unreal in life. You will no longer have conflicts about opinions of life?s many aspects and characteristics. You will know what is of importance and of no importance. Finally, you will reach the state where you will have achieved KARMYOGA, a state of long-lasting peace and happiness."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.54,"Arjuna asked the Lord:Dear KESHAVA (Krishna), what are the characteristics of a man who is very wise, has a firm intellect and is placed or engrossed in a superconscious state? How does this type of person speak, sit and walk?"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.55,"The Divine Lord Krishna replied: O ARJUNA, one is said to have steady wisdom if he completely frees himself from desires of the mind and heart and is realistically satisfied within himself, no more having the longing for material pleasures."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.56,"He whose mind is unaffected by misery or pleasure and is free from all bonds and attachments, fear and anger, is man, of steady wisdom and decisive intellect."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.57,"A man has a decisive intellect, who is no longer attached to anything, shoeing pleasure if something pleasan happens and displeasure if something unpleasant occurs.|"
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.58,"Just as a tortoise withdraws or retreats its limbs into its shell, a person with a firm mind and decisive intellect can withdraw his senses from sensual objects."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.59,"One who does not use his senses for the enjoyment of sensual objects can overcome and rise above sensual objects. However, he is not able to leave off the attachment to his senses. One who realizes God or the Supreme, gers rid of attachments to the senses as well."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.60,The Blessed Lord said: Even those who are wise and are striving to achieve spiritual happiness and freedom are carried away violently or with great force by their excited senses.
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.61,"The yogis or My divine devotees have gained or achieved self control; they have complete control of their senses and therefore they have also earned the power of constant wisdom. Their minds are constantly focussed and concentrated on ME, the Supreme Goal."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.62,"Those who always think about sensual objects get attached to those objects. Attachment arouses desires and when one does not get what one desires, irritation is aroused, and from irritation stems anger and frustration."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.63,"The Blessed Lord spoke: From anger, stems delusion (false beliefs or assumptions); delusion causes loss of one?s confused mind; the confused mind makes a person lose his/her ability to reason and lose their power to solve his/her problems. When one loses his/her power to reason, the person will suffer ultimate death and destruction."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.64,"But the disciplined wise man who has control over his senses and is free from attraction and emotional distractions, gains peace and purity of the self."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.65,"Purity of self gets rid of all miseries and grief. A person with internal purity soon develops steady wisdom and a clear, unclouded intelligence."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.66,"One who cannot control his senses is one who is lacking in steady wisdom and intelligence, and also lacks proper feelings or sentiments (thoughts). A person who cannot think properly and make decisions with a clear mind, cannot have peace of mind, and without peace of mind there can be no happiness."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.67,"The mind of those who run after or pursue material pleasures and sensual objects, is often clouded and let on the wrong path, just as the wind blows away the ship on the waters."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.68,"O ARJUNA, therefore with senses under control, protected from sensual objects, not only does one have the ability to reason things out properly, but also gains peace of mind leading to eternal bliss and happiness."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.69,"When it is night for all others, the wise man is always awake. When others are aware and deceived (deluded) by sensual objects, the wise man who knows the truth and has realized God, shuts his eyes to daylight and the misleading material objects that attract people, and considers it night. He is not easily deceived."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.70,"As the river enters the ocean without affecting the ocean or disturbing it, so the desires enter the person who has obtained Supreme peace, but not the person who is already filled with desires and wants more and more."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.71,"The Blessed Lord said: By giving up all desires, freeing oneself of all attachments and without constantly thinking of oneself or of one?s possessions, only then, one may live in realistic peace."
Sankhya Yoga,Chapter 2,Verse 2.72,"The Blessed Lord spoke: O ARJUNA, this is the state of a person who has truly realized God. After obtaining Supreme Bliss by realizing God, this person cannot be deceived by any of life?s evils. Until the time of death one remains firm in this state and ultimately achieves Supremr Peace and tranquility."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.1,"Arjuna asked the Good Lord: O Lord KRISHNA, if you claim that Gyan or Knowledge is better than one?s Karma or responsibility, the why do you ask me to fight this battle?"
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.2,"I am confused dear Lord, by the advice you have given to me. You have told me to take two opposite and different courses of action at once. Please, O KRISHNA, tell me of just one wise solution and course of action that would lead out of this problem safely."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.3,"The Blessed Lord replied: O Arjuna, always remember in life that there are only two definite paths of action as I have described before. One of these is known as Sankhyayoga or the path of knowledge, and the other is Karmayoga, or the path of performing duty and action without expecting any result."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.4,"O Arjuna, it is not only important to understand the meanings of Sankhyayoga and Karmayoga, but it is also important to understand the aims or goals behind each of these courses of action.The aim of Karmayoga is to achieve freedom from action. One cannot achieve the goal by total inaction or by not performing any action at all. The goal of Sankhyayoga is the realization of God. When one has fully realized God, he has reached a state of perfection. Once simply cannot attain this state of perfection by giving up or retreating from the performance of one?s actions."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.5,Lord Krishna continued:There is nobody who is living that does not perform an action of some sort even for a moment. Everyone is forced to perform actions by natural tendencies (human nature).
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.6,"O Arjuna, those who have learned to control the organs of action, yet still think in their minds of the pleasures that they can get from those organs, are fooling only themselves by pretending to have certain qualities that do not really exist within them."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.7,"The Blessed Lord spoke: O Arjuna, one who has fully learned to control his senses with his mind and practises selfless Karmayoga keeping his senses controlled and not allowing them to interfere and disrupt his action, is truly a great person."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.8,"Perform the actions that you have been obliged to perform, or that have been prescribed for you. Action is always better than inaction, If one is inactive, he cannot live, simply because he is not performing the action of maintaining his body."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.9,"The Lord continued: O Arjuna, all the actions that a person performs in this world, except of course those associated with sacrifice or Yagya, tie that person to the world. Therefore, O Arjuna to break free from this link, perform all your actions well without being attached to them."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.10,"Brahma has created the universe with the spirit of sacrifice. Brahma, the Creator, said unto mankind, ?You shall grow and prosper. Yagya (sacrifice) will bring you all that you wish.?"
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.11,"The Lord said unto Arjuna: The Gods or Deities grow with Yagya or sacrifice. When the Deities grow, they will help you to grow. Thus, both Deity and mankind grow continually. they will both achieve their supreme goal."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.12,"Through the spirit of sacrifice of Yagya, the Deities grow and progress. As they grow, they will provide you with all the pleasures you desire. You should offer part of these pleasures to the Deities.If one is granted pleasures by another person, the one who receives the pleasures should share some of those pleasures with the provider of those pleasures, or else he is as bad as a thief."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.13,"The Blessed Lord Krishna said:People who eat food after offering it for sacrifice are considered pious, pure, and are freed from all sins. People who prepare food only for themselves commit sins and are impure."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.14,"Food allows people to live. Food is produced from rain. Rain arises from sacrifice. Actions produce sacrifice or Yagna. God produces knowledge. Knowledge produces actions. Actions produce sacrifice or Yagya. Where there is sacrifice, the omnipresent God is there also."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.15,"Food allows people to live. Food is produced from rain. Rain arises from sacrifice. Actions produce sacrifice or Yagna.God produces knowledge. Knowledge produces actions. Actions produce sacrifice or Yagya.Where there is sacrifice, the omnipresent God is there also."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.16,"The Blessed Lord said: O Arjuna, he who does not follow the proper course of creation such as that I have just described, but centres his life around the enjoyment of luxuries, this sinful person, in my eyes, leads a useless life. He shall never fully understand and realize me."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.17,"He, O Arjuna, who is satisfied and content in himself, and he who is absorbed in himself, actions and duties do not exist (for him)."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.18,"This type of person has no use for actions (duties performed for the attainment of a certain goal), or inactions (duties performed without the expectation of any results).This type of person has reached a very high stage in the attainment of peace and detachment from all beings and things. He no longer selfishly depends on anybody or anything."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.19,"Therefore, Arjuna always perform your given duties without feelings of attachment towards any being or anything. A person doing unattached actions, or in other words, ?inction? attains the Lord, the key to perfection."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.20,"Wise men, such as King Janak, all attained the state of perfection by doing their duties and actions without any feelings of attachment to anyone or anything. Therefore, Arjuna, keeping in mind the goodwill and welfare of others in the world, do your duties and perform your actions selflessly."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.21,"If a great man sets an example for the world, the world will follow him. Whatever standards or values he sets, people generally will follow the same set of standards and values."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.22,"The Blessed Lord spoke: O Arjuna, take Me for example. There is nothing that is not available for me in this universe, nor is there any specific function or duty for me to perform, still, however, I perform Karma."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.23,"O Arjuna, if I do not perform my duties, the destruction of all regions of the universe will come about. Mixed castes will develop and all the beings on the face of this earth will be destroyed."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.24,"These worlds would if I did no do action, I would be the cause of confusion of castes and I would destroy these beings."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.25,"The Blessed Lord said: Just as the ignorant perform actions with attachment to things and/or beings, so should the wise men take action for the preservation of world order, without developing any attachments whatsoever, O Arjuna."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.26,"It is not a wise man?s concern or responsibility to fill the ignorant person?s mind with doubts, even if the latter is attached to his actions and constantly awaits results.However, he should encourafe these ignorant people just as any great man, by performing his own duties and actions unattached to them, as well as possible."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.27,"The Blessed Lord Krishna spoke: O Arjuna, all actions that are performed by beings, are done so by three modes of Prakrithi or three aspects of nature. However, ignorant people claim themselves as the performer of their actions."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.28,"He who understands fully, O Arjuna, the objects of perception (senses, mind, etc.), divisions of Prakrithi (nature), and selfless action, has the ability to understand the relationship of senses and sensual objects and never gets attached to any beings or objects."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.29,"The Lord spoke: Those who are deceived by the Gunas of nature or Prakrithi and are deceived by karma, develop an attachment to the Gunas and to their actions.A wise person would not disturb, or have anything to do with these ignorant beings, O Arjuna."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.30,"Dedicate and surrender all your actions unto me Oh Arjuna. Fix your mind on me, leaving behind you all feelings of hope, attachments and anguish."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.31,"Those wise people, with faith in Me, and those who follow my teaching, are always given freedom from their actions (Karma)."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.32,"On the other hand, O Arjuna, those of poor intelligence that do not follow my teaching are ignorant; regard them as mere fools."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.33,"All beings, wise or unwise, are forced to act by nature. What can restraint possibly do, O Arjuna?"
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.34,The Divine Lord stated:The enjoyment of sensual objects by their senses (an example of human nature) creates barriers to the path of Bliss and peace if one becomes a victim of attachment to his sesses.
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.35,"One?s own duty (Dharma) is more favourable than the well-established duty of others. To even encounter death, while performing one?s own duties (Dharma), is truly divine. However another person?s duty is filles with menace and fear."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.36,"Arjuna asked the Lord: O Lord Krishna, what motivates a person to commit sins that were committed involuntarily or by the force of others?"
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.37,"The Divine Lord replied: It is desire and wrath or anger arising from the evil (Rajasik) Guna in the form of the great fire of attachment. In this case, consider this fire the enemy and the sinner."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.38,"Just as the smoke surrounds and covers a fire, just as dust surrounds and covers a mirror, and just as the amnion covers the embryo, similarly. Gyan or knowledge is covered and surrounded by one?s desires. O Arjuna."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.39,"The wise men, O Arjuna, have one constant enemy, namely, the unending fire of desire which covers the Gyan or Knowledge of the wise."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.40,"The senses, mind, and one?s intellect are the home of desire O Arjuna. This covers Gyan and confuses the soul."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.41,"The Blessed Lord advised: Therefore, O Arjuna, restrain the senses first and control your sinful desires, the enemy of Gyan or knowledge."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.42,"O Arjuna, never understimate the senses for they are very powerful. The mind is stronger than the senses however, O Arjuna. The intellect is even stronger than one?s mind and the soul is still stronger than one?s intellect."
Karma Yoga,Chapter 3,Verse 3.43,"Therefore, Oh Arjuna, knowing that your soul is stronger than your intellect, and being aware that the intellect controls the mind, destroy that invincible and dominating enemy known as desire."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.1,"Lord Krishna continued:I taught this immortal, everlasting ?Yoga faction? (Karmayoga) to the Sun God Vivaswan.Vivaswan taught this knowledge to his son Manu and Manu taught this knowledge to his son Ikswaku."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.2,"By handing down this knowledge of Yoga from generation to generation this knowledge slowly deteriorated, and finally disappeared."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.3,"O Arjuna, I reveal this ancient and most important secret of Yoga unto you because you are My dear devotee and friend."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.4,"Arjuna asked Lord Krishna:Dear Lord, your birth on earth is very recent. The Sun however, took birth an extremely long time ago. I find it difficult then to understand how you could have told this ancient secret to Vivaswan the Sun God."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.5,"The Lord looked upon Arjuna and replied: Arjuna, the answer to your question is simple. You are forgetting, O Son of Kunti, the both you and I have taken many births in this world together. However, only I, Lord, can remember this; you cannot."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.6,"O Arjuna, although birth and death do not exist for Me, since I am the immortal Lord, I appear on earth, by my Divine powers and ability, keeping My nature (Maya) under control."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.7,"The Lord declared solemnly unto Arjuna: O Arjuna, whenever good is overcome by evil, or whenever evil manifests itself throughout the world in such a way that good no longer exists. I will always appear on earth."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.8,"O Arjuna, I appear on earth from time to time for three main purposes. The first is for the protection and preservation of all that represents good, and of all those pure and saintly people on earth. The second purpose for which I appear on earth is for the destruction and removed and wrong-doers.
The third purpose is, of course, for the establishment and creation (or recreation) of Dharma (Righteousness or reinstating moral values among people on earth.)"
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.9,"O Arjuna, I was born divinely, all my action (Karma) are divine. The one who knows and understands this fully in reality, is not born again after leaving the body. He comes to me in Heaven for eternity."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.10,"O Arjuna, if one really to seek refuge and be one with Me, he must totally free himself from passion, fear and anger, seek my protection only, and purify himself with the fire of Gyan (knowledge). If one manages to accomplish these thing, he will be able to become one with Me in mind and body."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.11,"O Arjuna, those people who love, trust and worship Me receive the same love, trust and worship from Me. All wise men follow Me in all respects. They follow my every path."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.12,"O Arjuna, those who do actions or Karma for the fulfillment of their desires and goals and those who worship deities (gods and god desses) for their prosperity, they will undobtedly achieve success quickly."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.13,The fourfold-caste has been created by Me according to the differentiation of GUNA an d KARMA; though I am the author thereof know Me as non-doer and immutable.
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.14,"The Lord continued: O Arjuna, since I, the immortal Lord, have no cravings for the fruits of action, I do not desire the reward of Karma. Therefore those who know me well are not affected or bound by Karma (action)."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.15,"The Lord continued:O Arjuna, ancient wise men who were searching for salvation in me, knew the facts well. However they even performed actions. Therefore O Arjuna, continue performing your actions doing your Karma as your ancestors once did in the past."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.16,"Even the wise men are confused about Karma (action) and Akarma (inaction). I shall now explain to you the truth about Karma. Knowing the truth, O Arjuna, you will be released from the bondage of Karma."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.17,"One should know the principle of Karma (action) Akarma (inaction) and forbidden Karma, (forbidden action). The philosophy behind Karma is very deep and mysterious. So listen closely."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.18,"One who sees action (Karma) in inaction (Akarma), and inaction in action, is a wise man and a great sage. That man who has accomplished all actions is a Yogi."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.19,"One who does all Karma without desire or attachment for the fruits of his Karma and one whose actions are burnt up in the of Gyan or wisdom, is regarded by even the wise men as a sage."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.20,"The Lord proclaimed: He who is totally unattached to the rewards of action, is forever happy and satisfied, who depends on nobody in this world, and is constantly involved in action, is really performing no action at all."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.21,"That person, O Arjuna, who has conquered his body and mind, who has given up all enjoyments and pleasures of the world, and who performs action only for the sake of maintaining his body, does not encounter or subiect himself to sin."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.22,"A person who is content with what he has who has no feeling of desire for other things, or uncertainty of any type, who has shed his envious feelings and who is above all even-minded in success and failure, such a person is no longer bound by Karma even if he still performs Karma."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.23,"Lord Krishna continued: A person who has no attachment to anything whatsoever in this world, whose heart is set on acquiring Gyan (wisdom), who works for the sake of sacrifice, and is a totally liberated person from the world, all actions for this person melt away and are meaningless."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.24,"The offerings in a sacrifice are Brahma (God), the sacrificial fire is Brahma (God), the one who performs the sacrifice is Brahma, the sacrifice itself is Brahma, the person performing the action of sacrifice is placed in Brahma and will reach Brahma, the ultimate goal of sacrifice."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.25,The Lord continued: Some Yogis prefer to perform sacrifice through the worship of deities (gods and god esses): other Yogis perform sacrifice to Brahma in the form of fire.
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.26,"Some offer, in the fire of self-control, one of their senses such as their hearing. (This signifies that the signifies has no attachment to any of his senses.)Others offer sensual objects (objects of perception), such as sound, in the fire of controlled senses.Signifying that the sacrificer has the will-power and restraint not to let his senses be influenced by evil, sin, or sensual objects of destruction."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.27,"Some Yogis sacrifice all the functions of their senses ans all their vital functions of life, into the fire of Yoga, in the shape of self control, which is kindled by Gyan (wisdom). (This signifies the sacrificer?s one-mindedness with the Lord, the Supreme Goal)."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.28,Sacrifices come in many forms. Giving away material wealth for charity is a sacrifice. Austerity is a sacrifice. Yoga is a sacrifice. Making vows and promises involve sacrifice. Even self-study is a sacrifice.
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.29,"Other Yogis (wise men) perform sacrifice by controlling the amount of breaths they take. By holding in their breath for a long periond of time whilepronouncing My name, they increase their life?s longevity. This act is known as PRANAYAM.Others perform sacrifice by controlling what they eat,(fasting). Those whose sins have been destroyed by sacrifice, understand the power and importance of sacrifice."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.30,"Other Yogis (wise men) perform sacrifice by controlling the amount of breaths they take. By holding in their breath for a long periond of time whilepronouncing My name, they increase their life?s longevity. This act is known as PRANAYAM.Others perform sacrifice by controlling what they eat,(fasting). Those whose sins have been destroyed by sacrifice, understand the power and importance of sacrifice."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.31,"O Arjuna, only those people who have sacrificed to achieve wisdom and knowledge of Gyan, go to Brahma, (the creator of all beings and God of Wisdom in the World). Without performing some sort of sacrifice in life, one cannot possibly remain happy in this world, not to mention the afterworl"
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.32,"The Lord continued:O Arjuna, many sacrifices are mentioned extensively throughout the Vedas. All of these sacrifices involve some sort of action or Karma to be performed. With this knowledge in mind, you will achieve the state of unattached Karma, or action done without the expectation of any results."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.33,"O Arjuna, sacrifice of wisdom (Gyan) is always better than sacrifice of material objects because all actions end with Gyan."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.34,"The Lord advised:O Arjuna, learn the principles of Gyan and ask questions about Gyan respectfully and with determination, from those who fully understand the principles of Gyan. Thay will explain ?Gyan? to you. Knowing Gyan, you will never be in the confused state as you are in now."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.35,"The Lord continued:O Arjuna, through Gyan, you will see all beings within yourself, and thereafter, all beings in Me."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.36,"O Arjuna, even if you are the greatest sinner in the world, this river of sins can be crossed with the boat of Gyan."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.37,"O Arjuna, as the burnig fire reduces fuel to ashes, in this same way, Karma (attached Karma binding a person to the material world), is burnt down with the fire of Gyan."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.38,"In this world, O Arjuna, there is no greater purifier than Gyan or wisdom itself. The person who has mastered Yoga to perfection feels wisdom in his soul at the proper time."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.39,"To abtain Gyan, one must conquer the senses, and develop a real devotion and faith towards the Lord. When one obtains Gyan, he has discovered the key to Supreme peace."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.40,"If a person is ignorant of the Knowledge of God, the person who lacks faith in God and the one who is full of doubts in his own self, will undoubtedly be destroyed. If one has doubts, he can never achieve peace and Bliss in the world, nor in the after-world."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.41,"One who has rid himself of attached Karma by practising Yoga and one who has rid himself of doubts by achieving Gyan, he is a self-realized person and is not bound by attached Karma."
Jnana-Karma-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 4,Verse 4.42,"Hence, be established in yoga by cutting the ignorance born doubt about the self with the sword of knowledge. Stand up, O Bharata."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.1,"Arjuna asked the Great Lord:Dear Krishna, I am still confused. I have heard praise of Yoga as well as of Sannyaas (Holy Pilgrimage), from You. Which one of these two O Lord, is the best path for me?"
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.2,"Oh Arjuna, both the paths of Yoga and Sannyaas lead one to supreme bliss and happiness. However, I shall always regard Yoga as the better path to the attainment of supreme peace and unity with Me, than the path of Sannyaas."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.3,"Oh Arjuna a true Sannyaasi is one who has no doubts about anything he does or encounters in his life; who has no enemies whatsoever, and above all, who is free from all desires (for material objects). If he has accomplished all these bondages of the world."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.4,"Oh Arjuna, in essense, Yoga and Sannyaas are the same because both of these achieve the same goal. Those who consider Yoga and Sannyaas as two different paths leading to the achievement of two different goals, are ignorant.When one is fully absorbed and established in either one of Yoga or Sannyaas, he achieves the results of both of these sacred institutions."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.5,"Yoga or Sannyaas (together known as Sankyoga) both attain the same goal for he who follows either of these paths. Only he who considers Yoga and Sannyaas as one, sees the ultimate Truth (the Lord)."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.6,"The Blessed Lord spoke in His Divine voice:O my dear Arjuna, in order for one to achieve Sannyaas, he must practise Karmyoga (doing Karma or actions without attachment or desire to see the results of those actions). If one is successful in performing Karmyoga (that is Karma without attachment to results), he shall realize God very quickly."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.7,"The Lord spoke onwards:The Karmyogi is a purified being who has conquered the self. He does not centre his life around himeself but around the achievement of being one with God.He detaches himeself from his senses, centering all his thoughts on God and achieving everlasting peace and happiness by breaking free of all material bondage to the world."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.8,"He who comes to the realization that, although he is physically performing actions such as seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing, speaking, receiving, sacrificing, opening and closing eyes, and so on, that he is actually doing nothing, is a Yogi. O Arjuna, the truly wise Yogi knows that in reality, only the senses are acting among their sense objects."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.9,"He who comes to the realization that, although he is physically performing actions such as seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing, speaking, receiving, sacrificing, opening and closing eyes, and so on, that he is actually doing nothing, is a Yogi. O Arjuna, the truly wise Yogi knows that in reality, only the senses are acting among their sense objects."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.10,"The Lord declared: One who leaves all the results of his actions to God and performs Karma without attachment, is immune to all sins of the world in the same way as a lotus leaf remains unmoistened when placed in water."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.11,"O Arjuna, Yogis purify their souls by abolishing any feelings of attachment within themselves by performing Karma through mind, body, intellect, and senses."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.12,"When a Yogi has reached a state of true self-realization by leaving all fruits and results of Karma in the hands of the Lord, he achieves true peace and happiness.However, he who does Karma (actions) for a selfish motive and for the attainment of fruits of his actions, never becomes free of the bondages of desire for material pleasures."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.13,"A person, having self-control, and mentally freeing himself of all actions (by the uninterest in results of actions), in really performs no actions whatsoever. By mentally detaching himself of all Karma, a man may live in true bliss and peace in his body of nine openings."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.14,"The Lord does not create the performance of actions (or Karma ), nor Karma itself, nor even the result of Karma. It is simply all due to nature performing its function in the world.(However, nature derives its motivation power from God.)"
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.15,"I, the all pervading Lord receives neither the good nor the bad Karma of anyone. People are from time to time deluded because their Knowledge (Gyan) is Covered up or blinded by ignorance (Agyan)."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.16,The Lord continued: People?s achievement of knowledge of their SELF has allowed them to destroy their ignorance or remove their lack of knowledge (Agyan). They soon find that the knowledge they acquire radiates the light of God within them.
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.17,"The Lord spoke: O Arjuna, total liberation and everlasting peace is achieved only by those whose mind and intellect constantly dwells on God and who have destroyed all sin by achieving Gyan (Knowledge)"
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.18,"The wise men treat everybody as equals O Arjuna, whether it be a learned and cultured Brahman, a cow, an elephant, or a dog and an outcaste. He not differentiate between anybody."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.19,"O Arjuna, those who are even-minded and treat everybody as equals in all respects, have reached the ultimate goal of life and have conquered the whole world because God is perfect, without defect, and makes no distinction also. Therefore, they are,in reality, one with God."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.20,"One truly becomes established in God when neither good circumstances make him happy, no bad Circumstance make him miserable. When a person reaches this type of balance in intellect and emotion, without a single doubt, with true knowledge of God, becomes eternally fixed in Him."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.21,"O Arjuna, a person who has totally detached himself from the material world and is happy and satisfied within his own self, attains eternal peace. When a person is truly established in the Yoga of God (service, devotion and prayers to Him), he experiences true, eternal bliss without a doubt, O Arjuna."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.22,"When one?s senses make contact with sensual, material goods, Arjuna, these desire-evoking objects are the cause of misery (these objects may appear enjoyable to material pleasure-seekers).These enjoyments are temporary, having a beginning and an end. When one develops a habitual desire for these artificial enjoyments. O Arjuna, he falls into deep misery and irrational behaviour as soon as these pleasures have disappeared from him."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.23,"One who is truly happy, peaceful and enlightened with his Soul, that wise man (Yogi) has combined with the supreme Soul (God) as one and attains freedom from all bondages to the world."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.24,"One who is truly happy, peaceful and enlightened with his Soul, that wise man (Yogi) has combined with the supreme Soul (God) as one and attains freedom from all bondages to the world."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.25,"Those wise men or sages who have abolished and destroyed all their sins with the achievement of true Gyan (Knowledge), and who have devoted themselves to the welfare of other beings, attain supreme and eternal peace."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.26,"O Arjuna, all of those wise men (Yogis) who have learned to control their minds, have learned to conquer and abolish all of the desires and anger within them, and have truly realized God, attain freedom and liberation from worldly ties in all respects."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.27,"A person who has totally detached himself from sense objects that give temporary pleasure and enjoyment, he who has learned to control and equalize the number of breaths going outwards and inwards through the nostrils, he who has brought his senses, mind and intellect under full control, and he who is desire less fearless and without anger, is always a free and liberated wise man."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.28,"A person who has totally detached himself from sense objects that give temporary pleasure and enjoyment, he who has learned to control and equalize the number of breaths going outwards and inwards through the nostrils, he who has brought his senses, mind and intellect under full control, and he who is desire less fearless and without anger, is always a free and liberated wise man."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 5,Verse 5.29,"The Lord declared:O Arjuna, he who shall consider ME the enjoyer of sacrifices and all that is internally pure, and who is devoted to ME, the God of all worlds and well-wisher of all beings, attains true, everlasting peace."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.1,Lord Krishna continued: A Sannyaasi is one who performs action or duty (Karma) without desiring any reward or other results for his actions. One cannot be a Sannyaasi or a Yogi by simply not petorming Karma.
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.2,"O Arjuna, consider Sannyaas and Yoga as one and the same; just as one becomes a Sannyassi by giving up all desires, similarly to be a Yogi one must do the same."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.3,"For one who wishes to establish himself in the divinity of Yoga. O Arjuna, he must follow the method of doing Karma without desires of any sort. For, giving up all worldly thoughts is the path that will lead you to being fully and truly established in Yoga, Dear Arjuna."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.4,"When one is no longer attached to sensual objects or to the Karma that he does, and when he has totally rid himself of all desires, at that time, a person is considered to be fully and undoubtedly established in Yoga."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.5,"Dear Arjuna, one should lift himself through his own efforts. He success or failure in performing his Karma should be the result of his own doing. Should a man fail, he should not degrade himself, O Arjuna, for he is his own true friend as well as his own true enemy."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.6,"The true self (soul) is only its own friend if it is free from attachment and in control of its own mind, body and senses. However, dear Arjuna, if one?s soul is not in control of mind body and senses, then the soul is its own enemy."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.7,"One who has truly achieved peace with the self and a balance in cold and heat, joy and sorrow, respect and disrespect, has a purified and liberated soul, God dwells in souls such as these and the soul thereby, becomes truly divine."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.8,"he Lord explained: When one?s mind is at peace and fully contented with the Gyan (Knowledge or wisdom) it has acquired, one whose mind is constantly stable and fixed in God, who has controlled his senses well and considers dirt, stone and gold as one, is said to have achieved unity with God. He is the perfect Yogi, O Arjuna."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.9,"One who thinks about and behaves with dear ones, friends, enemies, neutral ones, mediators malicious people, relatives, saints and sinful people, in the same manner, is truly a superior person."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.10,"Harboring insatiable lust, full of hypocrisy, pride and arrogance, the demoniac cling to their false tenets. Thus illusioned, they are attracted to the impermanent and work with impure resolve."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.11,"For proper meditation, the Yogi should seek a clear spot, covered with grass, deer skin and/or clothing, which is neither very high nor very low, to seat himself."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.12,"He should then practice Yoga for the purpose of purifying his mind and soul, focusing his thoughts on one point (God) at all times, and fully controlling the function of mind and senses."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.13,"The Lord instructed Arjuna:While meditating one must keep the head, neck and torso (upper body) as straight and as steady as possible, without even a slight movement.firmly looking at the tip of the nose and looking in no other direction whatsoever."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.14,"It is said the fruit of actions performed in the mode of goodness bestow pure results. Actions done in the mode of passion result in pain, while those performed in the mode of ignorance result in darkness."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.15,"In this way, the true, self-controlled Yogi. Will inevitably attain eternal peace and be in the highest state of bliss by fixing his mind on Me during (proper) meditation."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.16,"There must be a constant balance in everything a Yogi does. Eating too much or eating very little, sleeping too much or sleeping very little, for example, are not methods of succeeding in this Yoga."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.17,"O Arjuna, only those people who eat, live, work and sleep moderately, and destroy all misery, succeed in this Yoga."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.18,"When one has freed himself of all desires, he will then always be firmly established in Yoga. When one has full control of his mind, he will be fully established in God."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.19,"The Almighty explained: Just as the flame of a lamp does not flicker in a place without wind, in the same way the controlled mind of the Yogi does not get distracted by worldly objects or pleasures."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.20,"By the practice of Yoga, one?s mind becomes peaceful and calm and the mind that has truly realized God through meditation attains spiritual happiness, enjoyment and bliss only in God."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.21,"O Arjuna, the limitless and everlasting joy and bliss that a true Yogi feels cannot be perceived by the ordinary senses, but can only be felt by a person who has a subtle, keen and clever intellect. When this Yogi has discovered this true happiness, he will never stray or move away from the Truth, Arjuna."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.22,"Having achieved this divine state of bliss, Dear Arjuna, the Yogi realizes that no other state or condition could be greater, thus even the most intense pains will never lead the Yogi astray from Truth or devotion to Me, the Supreme Soul."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.23,Yoga is the means to liberate (free) one from all miseries of the world. Yoga should always be practical with a fixed mind and determination.
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.24,"Once one has completely given up all desires created from his imagination and once one has learned to mentally control all of his senses, one slowly and gradually becomes peaceful. A true Yogi with a steady intellect fixes his mind only on God and thinks of nothing else but the Lord."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.25,"Once one has completely given up all desires created from his imagination and once one has learned to mentally control all of his senses, one slowly and gradually becomes peaceful. A true Yogi with a steady intellect fixes his mind only on God and thinks of nothing else but the Lord."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.26,"The unsteady, wandering and constantly distracted mind should always be controlled and fixed in God."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.27,"Lord Krishna explained:The true Yogi has a peaceful mind, is free from sin and all evils of the world, becomes and eternal bliss."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.28,"The sinless Yogi is constantly engaged in Yoga, and experiences no difficulty in achieving the greatest bliss and happiness of all, O Arjuna. That is, uniting and being one with Me, the Lord."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.29,"he wiseman who is forever engaged in performing Yoga, never discriminates against anybody because he sees his own self in all beings, and all beings within his own self."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.30,"The Lord explained: O Arjuna, he who truly sees Me everywhere he looks, sees me in everything. I am always there within his sight and he is also always within my sight."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.31,"The Lord proclaimed: O Arjuna, I am present in all beings. He who worships me with a steady, peaceful and undistracted mind, is a true Yogi and he dwells within Me in My heart always."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.32,"Dear Arjuna, the Yogi who looks upon all beings as his own self, treats all beings equally, and considers happiness and misery as the same, is truly a great being himself."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.33,"Arjuna asked Shri Krishna: Dear Lord, I simply cannot regard the Yoga of even-mindedness as a firm and stable exercise because of the instability of the mind itself."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.34,"Dear Krishna, the mind is truly very unstable, forceful and strong. It is just as difficult to control as the flow of the wind."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.35,"Lord Krishna divinely replied: Dear Arjuna, undoubtedly, the mind, as you say, is difficult to control, yet with paractice, determination and detachment, it can be controlled."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.36,"Lord Krishna continued: In my opinion, O Arjuna, without a controlled mind, it is difficult for one to attain Yoga (attaining God). However, with a reasonable effort, the Yoga of even-mindedness (path to achieving the Lord) can be achieved by a person who has learned to control his senses."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.37,"Arjuna asked the Lord:Dear Lord Krishna, what becomes of a man who has a firm belief in Yoga and has set foot on the path of Yoga, but allows his mind to deviate or stray from this path which leads to perfection?"
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.38,Arjuna continued: What happens to a man who can no longer continue on this path leading to the attainment of God (Yoga)? Is he destroyed and does he lose both worlds of Yoga (God-realization) and that of worldly enjoyment just as the clouds are scattered by the winds?
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.39,"Lord Krishna, this is one of the doubts I have in my mind. You can remove it entirely. If anybody can remove all my doubts Krishna, it is You, and only You. Nobody else can clear My doubts completely."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.40,"Lord Krishna replied: Dear Arjuna, the answer to your question is quite simple. A person who strives for God-realization (Yoga) never suffers deterioration or destruction. He is never destroyed in this world or in the other world regardless of whether he realizes Me fully or not."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.41,"The unsuccessful person in Yoga, Dear Arjuna, achieves an abode or home in heaven, the place of pious, pure. He stays there for a long time and after a while, takes birth in the house of noble people of good conduct."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.42,"Dear Arjuna, if he does not take birth in a noble family of good conduct, then he will be born into a family of wise yogis.Such a birth in the world is difficult to find and can only be achieved if your actions are pious, good-natured and unsinful."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.43,"When a man takes birth in his next life, he attains the wisdom he had achieved from the pious actions he performed in the pious actions of his past life, he tries harder once more to achieve true eternal peace and happiness in God through Yoga."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.44,"As a result of the religious practices of his past life, he remains free of attachments and is attracted towards God by constantly practising Yoga although he may be under bad and unfavourable influences."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.45,"After practicing Yoga during many births, there by destroying all sins and totally purifying the Self, the Yoga attains the supreme state, i.e. Salvation (total liberation from the world)."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.46,"Lord Krishna stated: O Arjuna, the Yogi is superior to all those who perform religious sacrifices and superior to those who read holy scriptures and, of course, to those who perform attached Karma. Therefore, Arjuna, you should strive to be a Yogi."
Atma-Samyama Yoga,Chapter 6,Verse 6.47,"Of all the Yogis, the one who has complete faith in Me, whose mind is attached to Me only, and who continually worships Me, is absolutely the superior among all Yogis."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.1,"Lord Krishna further explained:Dear Arjuna, with your mind fully absorbed in thoughts of Me and in the practice of Yoga as well, with total reliance on Me alone, listen to the secret of how to really know Me in entirety."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.2,"After I divulge this secret to you, the knowledge you will have attained from this secret of the Supreme (God) will make all other knowledge seem worthless for you, O Arjuna."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.3,"It is very difficult to know Me fully in reality, dear Arjuna. Out of thousands of people, only a few special ones (Yogis or divine devotees) try to realize Me. Even out of those perfect people trying to realize Me, only a few succeed in doing so. Hardly anybody know My reality."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.4,"My nature,dear Arjuna, is formed by eight elements, namely, earth, fire, wind, water, sky, mind, intellect and ego. O Arjuna, understand that the elements I have just mentioned to you are only part of My lower nature. The other part of Me is My higher nature, which preserves the universe."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.5,"My nature,dear Arjuna, is formed by eight elements, namely, earth, fire, wind, water, sky, mind, intellect and ego. O Arjuna, understand that the elements I have just mentioned to you are only part of My lower nature. The other part of Me is My higher nature, which preserves the universe."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.6,"The Lord spoke solemnly: O Arjuna, you must understand that I have created all beings in these two aspects of my nature. Arjuna, Know Me as both the creator and the destroyer of the world."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.7,"Arjuna, there is in reality absolutely nothing else but Me, I am all there is in this whole universe and everything is threaded into Me like the pearls in a necklace."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.8,"Dear Arjuna, I am the essence (the life) of water. I am the light in the Moon and the Sun; I am the ?OM? in all of the Vedas (Holy Scriptures of the Hindu Religion). I am the sound and vibrations in the sky and the manliness in all men."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.9,"I am the aroma (fragrance) in the earth, the radiance in the fire. I am ?life? in all beings, and I represent the sacrifice in all religious and sacrificial ceremonies."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.10,"Arjuna, know Me; I am the core of all beings. I am the intelligence in the intelligent, and I represent the valour in the valiant men of this world."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.11,"Arjuna, my dear devotee, I am the strength in those that are strong and who are free from desire and attachment. I am the controlled, passion in all beings not contrary to Dharma."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.12,"Arjuna, I am also all the thoughts borne out of Sattvik (pure), Rajasik (high activity) and Tamasik (evil) elements that surround this world. Consider them all as created by Me. However, always remember, I am neither in them, nor are they in me."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.13,"The whole universe, o Son of Kunti, is deluded by the Sattvik, Rajasik, and Tamasik Gunas (Components or Parts of nature). However,the truth is that I, the Supreme, Imperishable God, am above all of these Gunas."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.14,"Because My divine nature (many) consisting of these three parts, is very powerful,only those who continuously worship me, rise above these three Gunas (parts of nature) and cease to be deluded by them."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.15,"Those who have lost their Gyan (wisdom) because of the pursuit of power (maya) and those who are evil in nature and are constantly engaged in evil deeds, do not worship Me, O Arjuna."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.16,"In this world there are only four types of pure and divine (pious) people who worship Me,dear Arjuna; those in distress, the seekers of knowledge and wisdom, the wise (Yogis) and those who desire material wealth."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.17,"Among all of these, O Arjuna, only the wise who are always thinking of Me with true love and devotion, are special and dear to Me, and I am dear to them as well."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.18,"Although all of those who worship Me,Arjuna, are dear and sublime to Me, But because I regard a Gyani (man of wisdom) or Yogi to be of my own image, that Yogi will always reside in Me, the Almighty."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.19,"A Gyani or wise man who worship Me with great love and devotion during many or all of his birth, truly realizes Me as the ?be-all? and the ?end-all?. And he is considered by Me to be a great sage."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.20,"Driven by the desires which exist in their nature, ignorant people worship other Deities with rituals."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.21,"Whichever god (deity) a person wishes to worship with faith, O Arjuna, I am the one who establishes or builds his faith in that deity."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.22,"Thus, once these people have been given their faith by Me, the devotees try to worship the deities they choose to worship, and they ultimately achieve their desires as ordered and directed by Me, the Deity of deities"
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.23,"The Lord said solemnly: But the reward of those ignorant people who worship other deities is only temporary. Those who worship other deities go to those deities after death but those who worship Me, attain Me, and come to Me."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.24,"Dear Arjuna, those people who have little intelligence fail to regard Me as the Supreme, indestructible, the Almighty, and unmanifest (not readily perceived by the senses); instead, they regard Me as a mere mortal and ordinary human being."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.25,"Shrouded by My own Yogmaya (divine powers), I am not visible to everybody. Those who are ignorant, however, do not know Me as unborn and indestructible (eternal). They will never be able to see Me, O Arjuna. Only those who are dear and devoted to Me, see Me."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.26,"O Arjuna, although I know of every single being who was in the past, who is at the present, and who will be in the future, nobody really knows Me."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.27,"Arjuna, in this world, most beings are confused and deluded by the doubts created by desire and envy, and they become victims of ignorance and Agyan (lack of wisdom)."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.28,"O Arjuna, there are, however, some pious people whose sins have been destroyed and are free from all worldly attachments, who worship Me with a firm, undeluded mind."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.29,"Arjuna, those who make an effort to attain Me and take refuge in Me, achieve deliverance from old age and death, and they also fully understand Brahma, (the infinite never-ending) Adhyatma (self) and all Karma (actions) in this world."
Jnana-Vijnana Yoga,Chapter 7,Verse 7.30,"Only those wise men (Yogis) who truly know Me as being above all elements of the world (Adhibhutha), above all Deities, and above all sacrifices, experience Me even at the end of their existence on earth (death), and they ultimately attain Me, the Supreme Soul."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.1,"Arjuna askedthe Lord:Dear Krishna, I have often encountered the terms Brahman, Adhyatma, Karma, Adhibhutam and Adhidaivam, yet I fail to understand the true meaning of these."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.2,"Arjuna continued: Furthermore, O Krishna, I am puzzld by the Adhiyoga. Who is he? How does he dwell in one?s body? Lastly, dear Lord, how do true Yogis come to know you in the ultimate end."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.3,"The Lord replied:Dear Arjuna, always remember that Brahma is the Supreme imperishable (everlasting); the Universal Soul. The Jeevatma or the soul within one?s body is known as Adhyatma.Karma is the offering made to the Gods that causes the creation or manifestation and also the preservation or sustenance of beings."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.4,"The Lord further explained: Adhibhutam represents all perishable or temporary objects. Brahma, the Universal Soul is the Adhidaivam. O Arjuna, I the Vasudeva, am Adhiyga here in this body and form."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.5,"Lord Krishna solemnly proclaimed: O Arjuna, he who thinks only of Me at the time of his death, undoubtedly will come to Me."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.6,"O Arjuna, whatever entity (being or object) one thinks about during the time of his death while leaving his body, that is what he shall become in his next life."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.7,"Therefore,O Arjuna, think of Me at all times, even while you fight this battle. If you surrender your mind and intellect to Me, dear friend, you will undoubtedly come to Me and unite with Me in heaven."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.8,"Arjuna, one who is constantly performing meditation upon God without letting his mind wander in any other direction, achieves supreme salvation (union with God)"
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.9,"Dear Arjuna, one who is constantly fixed in meditation upon God, who is the omniscient (everywhere), omnipotent (ever-powerful), infinite (never-ending) ruler over all being, preserver of everybody, whose form cannot be conceived readily by any being, who is as brilliant as the Sun, and who is beyond the darkness of ignorance."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.10,"The Lord Continued: That devoted person, at time of death, with a controlled mind, full of devotion to God, by the power of Yoga, fixing his last few breath in his life in between his eyebrows, only remembering the Supreme God, obtains God, the Supreme Divine Being."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.11,"The Blessed Lord Spoke: O Arjuna, that which the scholars of the Vedas (those who study and are knowledgeable of the Vedas), who are self-controlled and passion-free. enter into, leading the life of celibacy and detachment from all things and being, this Supreme Being shall be made clear to you briefly."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.12,"When a Yogi has fully controlled all of his senses, fixes his mind in the heart, concentrates on nothing but God, concentrates all of his life?s breath in his head, fully establishes his being in the practice of Yoga. Just as one is about to leave his body, he should chant ?Om? as one of God?s many names, thinking of Me(the Lord) in the last few moments of his life. This is the key to the attainment of the Supreme state known as salvation."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.13,"Uttering the one-syllabled OM ? the (symbol of) BRAHMAN ? and remembering Me, he who departs, leaving the body, attains the Supreme Goal."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.14,"O Arjuna, the Yogi who is established in Me, with his mind constantly fixed on Me, continually remembering Me, can easily attain me."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.15,"O Arjuna, the great sages (wise men,Yogis) having achieved Supreme perfection in their life, come to Me, and do not take rebirth which is temporary and full of suffering."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.16,"All the worlds in the universe, including this one, O Arjuna, are subject to appear and disappear, go and return again, to be created and recreated, but, Arjuna, when one has attained Me, he is never born again into this world of suffering and temporary pleasure."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.17,"Those who knows that Brahma?s (the Supreme Creator) one day lasts 1,000 yugas and one night ends 1,000 yugus, truly know the essence of time."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.18,"Dear Arjuna, try to understand that all that is visible in this world comes out from within Brahma (Creator of the world) at the start of his day."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.19,"O Arjuna, all beings in this world, by the force of their nature, are born again and again, and dissolve repeatedly as well. They perish and join Brahma at the start of his night, and are born again at the start of his day."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.20,"O Arjuna, one should always remember that there is a path that leads out of this cycle and into a world of eternal unmanifest, where one is never subject to being born, destroyed and reborn again. It is a world of immortality in which one lives forever in peace and eternal happiness"
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.21,"The unmanifest (uncreated) is eternal and indestructible, O son of Kunti, and is the ultimate goal for all beings to achieve.When one has finally reached this ultimate goal, he does not come back into this world of temporary pleasure and misery. He achieves supreme bliss, peace and contentment. He then lives forever in My Supreme Abode."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.22,"Dear Arjuna, that God within whom all beings are contained and that God who rules over all the universe, can be attained by complete devotion."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.23,"Dear Arjuna, now I shall tell you of the two paths by which the Yogi returns (comes back and is born into this world again) and by which the Yogi does not return (is not born into this world again.)"
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.24,"Those Yogis who follow the path of fire, light, daytime, bright fortnight, and the six months of the northern path of the sun, go to Brahma and are not born into the world again."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.25,"Those Yogis who follow the path of smoke, night-time, the dark fortnight, the six months of southern path, go to heaven and are eventually reborn back into the world."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.26,"The Blessed Lord Krishna continued: These bright and dark paths are considered to be the two original paths of the universe. By following the bright path, the Yogi reaches the Supreme State from where there is no return. Going by the other path, the Yogi is subject to birth and death as many times as he chooses to follow this path.
"
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.27,"O Arjuna, knowing these two paths, no Yogi ever becomes confused, deluded or unhappy. Therefore Arjuna, you should try to achieve Yoga, the Supreme state of happiness, at all times."
Aksara-ParaBrahma Yoga,Chapter 8,Verse 8.28,"Whatever achievements are obtained by the study of the Vedas, by sacrifices, and by giving to charities, the Yogi goes beyond all of these achievements and achieves the ultimate goal and learns the ultimate secret: the attainment of the eternal Supreme state by constantly practising Yoga."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.1,"Lord Krishna continued: Dear Arjuna, I shall explain to you this ultimate secret and Gyan which is the knowledge of all that is manifest (to emerge from Brahma and be born in this world) and all that is unmanifest (to become one with Brahma and forever be liberated from this world of suffering)."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.2,"This Gyan is the most significant secret knowledge in the universe, O Arjuna. It is very pure and helpful to all beings. It produces direct and favourable results. This virtuous secret is easy to practice and is imperishable."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.3,"Arjuna, those people who do not have faith in these principles and in this secret knowledge do not attain Me (the ultimate goal) and thus, move into a world if darkness and death."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.4,I am present in all of the universe (on every world) in my unmanifest (unseen) form. All beings are contained in Me but I am not always contained in them.
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.5,"O Arjuna, you must also understand that all the beings in this universe are not within Me.
Behold the effects of My Yoga (spiritual power), though I sustain and create all beings, in reality, My Self dwells not in these beings."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.6,"Arjuna, you must clearly understand that just as the vast wind moves in all directions in the sky, similarly all beings are placed in Me."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.7,"O Arjuna, all beings realize and attain My true nature at the end of Brahma?s Day knows as Kalpa. I, the Supreme Being, create them again at the beginning of every Kalpa."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.8,"O Arjuna, I create all beings again and again according to their karma (performed actions in their past life) out of My Maya (spiritually powerful nature)."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.9,"Dear Arjuna, Karma has no affect on Me whatsoever. I am unattached and indifferent to Karma. I have no bondage to Karma at all."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.10,"Dear Arjuna, under My supervision, it is through My Maya (nature) that the universe is created with all animate and inanimate (living and non-living) beings. It is because of this fact that the whole universe revolves around the cycle of birth and death."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.11,"Not knowing and fully understanding My Supreme Nature, all ignorant and unspiritual people in this world regard Me as insignificant when I am in human form. They fail to see and realize that I am the Lord of all beings."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.12,"The Lord spoke onward: These ignorant people with futile hopes, vain actions (Karma), and false knowledge (spiritual and non-spiritual Gyan) have a misleading and evil nature."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.13,"But, Arjuna, always heed that all saints, Yogis and wise men, with their godly, spiritual nature,regard Me as the prime cause of all beings (the Creator of the world) and indestructible. They worship Me with one-mindedness, never letting their minds go astray and be affected by worldly objects, attachment to Karma, and false Gyan."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.14,"True devotees of mine, O Arjuna, always have a firm belief in Me, constantly chant My name, bowing before Me, are always absorbed in My thought and worship Me with true love and devotion."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.15,"Several people worship Me in different ways, My dear friend. Some choose to worship Me with their offering of knowledge (Gyan Yagya); others worship Me in my absolute (formless) form as part of their own self; and still others choose to worship Me as their Divine Master, in My several different and diverse forms. However, Arjuna, realize that I am One and Universal even though I take on several forms."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.16,"Arjuna, you must understand that I am everything in this world.
I am the Vedic rituals; I am the sacrifice and the offerings (Yogya); I am the represent all herbal life
I am the Mantra (Vedic); I am purified butter; I am fire; I am the very act of offering in sacrifices."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.17,"I am the sustainer, the father,mother, and grandfather of the whole universe. I represent all that is knowable and worth knowing
I am the Supreme Purifier of all things in the Universe and I represent all of the Vedas in the Universe also, namely, Rig Veda, Yajur Veda and Sama Veda."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.18,"O Dear Arjuna, I support and preserve all the creation in the universe; I am the Supreme Lord of all; the witness of all occurrences, the shelter; the refuge; the well-wisher of all beings; the absolute beginning and origin of things, and the absolute end termination of all things.
Furthermore, Arjuna, I am the resting place and storage place (refuge) into which all beings come together when the time of universal destruction is at hand. Know Me also, as the one imperishable, indestructible seed from which all beings in the universe are cultivated."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.19,"O Arjuna, I am the giver of heat; I am responsible also, for the sending and holding back of rain for the nourishment of all life.
You must understand, My dear friend, that I am the very nectar (the juice) of life within all beings, and at the same time, I am the death of all beings. Arjuna, I am all that is real and unreal in this universe."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.20,"Those who perform actions (as described in the three Vedas), desiring fruit from these actions, and those who drink the juice of the pure Soma plant, are cleansed and purified of their past sins. Those who desire heaven, (the Supreme Abode of the Lord known as Indralok) attain heaven and enjoy its divine pleasures by worshipping Me through the offering of sacrifices. Thus, by performing good action (Karma) as outlined by the three Vedas, one will always undoubtedly receive a place in heaven where they will enjoy all of the divine pleasure that are enjoyed by the Deities."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.21,"However, Arjuna, after all of their good Karma (action) has expired, the enjoyment of all of the happiness, joy and peace that they have encountered in heaven ends as well, and therefore, they are reborn in the world (subject to the cycle of birth and death) once more.
Therefore, Arjuna, all beings who perform attached Karma (actions performed for the purpose of gaining something, i.e. fruits, in return for the action), are always born and reborn into this cycle of birth and death according to the three Vedas."
Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.22,"However, Arjuna, for those beings who worship Me with a fixed mind, meditating and constantly thinking of Me, worshipping Me without any desire for rewards in return for their worship, are granted full refuge and salvation in My Supreme Abode (Heaven).

Raja-Vidya-Raja-Guhya Yoga,Chapter 9,Verse 9.29,"I regard all beings with equality and with even-mindedness. I neither hate nor love anybody, nor do I like or dislike anyone. However, those who choose to worship Me, with everlasting and pure devotion, are always in Me, and I am in them."

Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.37,"To think that any wiseman would do anything else but bow down before Your infinite greatness. is unwise, O Blessed Lord, Lord of Lords, Spirit Supreme! You are the Lord of Brahma (the Lord of Creation). You, my Dear Lord, are the never-ending, eternal refuge of the world. You are all that exists, that is non-existent, and that is even beyond existence."
Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.38,You are the first and foremost of Gods; You are the beginning of all existence and are the support of this vast universe.

Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.39,You are the wind (Vayu); Yama (the destroyer); You are the Sea-God (Varuna); the moon (Lord Sasanka); the Grand King of all (Prajapati). Hail to Thee O Lord! A thousand adorations to thee! Again and again to thee everyone hails!

Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.41,"O Madhava (Krishna). my dear comrade and Lord, for whatever I have unthinkingly said to You, ignorant of the fact  that You are very much more a Greater Being than simply MY companion in battle; for my utter ignorance or maybe out of fondness?
?for whatsoever I have incorrectly presumed about You; for my irreverence and disrespect when alone with You or amongst companions; for making fun or teasing You at play or at rest: for all these things, dear Lord, please find it in Your divine heart to forgive Me for this ignorance."

I have revealed to you O devotee of Mine, the luminous vision of Me which no mortal has observed before."
Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.48,"The Blessed Lord spoke solemnly: O Arjuna, you the greatest of Kurus alone has seen My true and Supreme form.

Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.52,"The Blessed lord said:Dear Arjuna, the Divine form of Myself which you have seen with so much difficulty is an experience which even the other gods and godesses in heaven long to see."
Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.53,"Not even with such religious acts as ritual offerings, gifts to the unfortunate and poor, and by leading a life only of worship and devotion to Me, can one be so fortunate as to witness what you have."
Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.54,"It is only by true love and selfless devotion that one can truly come to know Me, see Me in My true form, and be an eternal part of Me."
Viswarupa-Darsana Yoga,Chapter 11,Verse 11.55,He who truly loves Me; devotes his whole life to performing actions to please only Myself; who recognizes that I am the Supreme and final goal of life; who is free from all attachment and has love for all that I have created; that man comes to truly know who I am.
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.1,Arjuna asked: Those devotees who worship you as the one without attributes (formless) and those who worship you as the one with attributes (with form); which of these are better versed in Yoga?
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.2,"The Blessed Lord said: Those who have fixed their minds on Me and worship me with total dedication and faith, them I consider perfect in Yoga."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.3,"But those who worship the formless, the Indefinable, the Imperishable, the Unmanifest, the Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the Unchangeable, the Immovable, the External- Having controlled all of the senses, always evenminded, thinking of the welfare of all beings, they also come to Me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.4,"But those who worship the formless, the Indefinable, the Imperishable, the Unmanifest, the Omnipresent, the Unthinkable, the Unchangeable, the Immovable, the External- Having controlled all of the senses, always evenminded, thinking of the welfare of all beings, they also come to Me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.5,"However, the worship of God without form is very difficult for the embodied because it is very hard to set the mind on the unmanifest, i.e. the one not capable of being recognized with the aid of the senses."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.6,"But those who worship Me, dedicating all actions to Me, regarding Me as the Supreme Goal, meditating on Me with single-mindness."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.7,"These worshippers? thoughts are set on Me; hence O Arjuna, I become their saviour from the wheel of birth and death."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.8,"Therefore, fix your mind on Me alone, let your thoughts reside in Me. You will hereafter live in Me alone. Do not have any doubt about it."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.9,"If you are not able to set your mind on Me, O Arjuna, then wish to reach Me by the Yoga of constant practice."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.10,"If you are unable to perform the Yoga of constant practice, then be intent on doing your actions for My sake; thus, performing actions for My sake, you will attain perfection."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.11,"If you cannot do actions for My sake, then taking refuge in Me, renounce (abandon) all the fruits of action by controlling yourself."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.12,"To gain spiritual knowledge is better than to practise Yoga; Meditation is better than Knowledge, abandoning the fruit of action is better than meditation because peace immediately follows the abandoning of the fruits of action."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.13,"The Lord describes the divine qualities of a devotee: He who hates no one, who is friendly and compassionate to all, who is free of egoism, balanced in pain and pleasure and forgiving. He who is ever content, ever steady in meditation, self-controlled and firmly committed with mind and intellect fixed on Me, that devotee is dear to Me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.14,"The Lord describes the divine qualities of a devotee: He who hates no one, who is friendly and compassionate to all, who is free of egoism, balanced in pain and pleasure and forgiving. He who is ever content, ever steady in meditation, self-controlled and firmly committed with mind and intellect fixed on Me, that devotee is dear to Me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.15,"He who does not harm anyone in the world and from whom the world is not agitated, and he who knows no joy, envy, fear and anxiety, that devotee is dear to me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.16,"He who is free from desires, who is pure, expert, unconcerned, free from pain, selfless in all of his actions, he who is thus devoted to Me, is dear to Me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.17,"He who neither rejoices (obtaining the desirable objects), nor hates (the undesirable objects), nor grieves (losing his beloved objects), nor desires (his beloved objects), free from the notions of good and evil, full of devotion, he is dear to Me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.18,"He who is the same to enemy and friend and also in honour and dishonour, in cold and heat, in pleasure and pain, and who is free from attachment-"
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.19,"He who is neutral in censure and praise, He who is silent, content with anything (in the world), does not claim any residence as his home, he who is steady-minded, full of devotion; that man is dear to Me."
Bhakti Yoga,Chapter 12,Verse 12.20,"They who follow this immortal law as described above, endowed with faith, looking upon Me as their supreme goal and being devoted, are extermely dear to Me."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.1,"The Blessed Lord said:This body, O Arjuna, is called Kshetra (the field); he who knows it is called Kshetragya (the knower of the field) by the sages (those who have acquired spiritual knowledge)."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.2,"The Blessed Lord said: This body, O Kaunteya is called KSHETRA (the Field) and he who knows it is called KSHETRAJNA (the Knower-of-the-Field) by those who know them (KSHETRA and KSHETRAJNA) i. e. , by the sages ."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.3,"And you should know Me as the knower of the field in all fields, O Arjuna. The knowledge of both the field and the knower of the field is considered by Me to be real knowledge."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.4,"What the field is, what it is like, what is its nature, what are its properties and modifications, from what causes, and also, who He (the knower of the field) is, and what His powers are; hear briefly all that from Me."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.5,RISHIS have sung (about the Field and the Knower-of-the-Field ) in many ways in various distinctive chants and also in the suggestive words indicative of BRAHMAN full of reason and decision.
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.6,"The great elements, egoism, intellect, and also the unmanifested (MOOLA-PRAKRITI) , the ten senses and the one (the mind) and the five objects-of-the-senses, . . ."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.7,"Desire, hatred, pleasure, pain, the body, intelligence, firmness; these along with their modifications have been called the field (Kshetra)."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.8,"Humility, modesty, non-injury, forgiveness, uprightness, service of the teacher, purity, steadfastness, self-control."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.9,"Indifference to the sense-objects (such as sound, touch, etc.);absence of egoism (e.g. I am superior to all); reflection on the evil in birth, death, old age, sickness and pain."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.10,"Non-attachment, non-identification of self with son, wife, house, and the rest, and constant even-mindedness on the occurrence of the desirable and undesirable."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.11,"Unflinching devotion to Me by the Yoga of non-separation, resort to solitary places, distaste for the society of worldly-minded people."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.12,"Constant awareness of the Self (self-knowledge),perception of the end of true knowledge ? that is declared to be the true knowledge, and what is opposed to it is ignorance."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.13,"I shall now state that which has to be known, knowing which one attains to immortality; the Supreme Brahman is beginningless and he is called neither ?Sat? (being) nor ?Asat? (non-being)."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.14,"With hands and feet everywhere, with eyes, heads and mouths everywhere, with ears everywhere, He (the knower of the field) exists enveloping all."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.15,"Shining by the functions of all the senses (see previous verses for the names of the senses), yet without the senses (i.e. organs), unattached, yet supporting all. devoid of Gunas (qualities), yet He experiences them."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.16,"He is outside and inside all beings; the unmoving and also the moving ; because of His subtlety (like ether), he is unknowable. He is far and near."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.17,"He is undivided and yet he appears to be divided in beings. He supports, swallows up and also creates all beings."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.18,"He is light of all lights and is said to be beyond darkness. He is Knowledge, the Knowable (that which has to be known) and the goal of Knowledge, and He is seated in the hearts of all."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.19,"Thus the field, knowledge and the knowable have been briefly stated (by Me). My devotee, on knowing this, becomes one with Me."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.20,"You must know that nature and spirit are both without being, and know also that all modifications and qualities are born of nature."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.21,"Both the effect and the cause are generated from nature, and the spirit (soul) is the cause in the experience of pain and pleasure."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.22,The spirit (soul) residing in nature experiences the qualities born of nature; this attachment to the qualities is the cause of his birth in pure (good) and impure (evil) wombs.
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.23,"The Supreme Soul in this body is also called the spectator, the permitter, the supporter, the enjoyer, the Great Lord and the Supreme Self (Parmatma)."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.24,"He who thus knows the Soul and Nature with the qualities, he is never born again regardless of the conditions he lives in."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.25,"Some by Yoga of meditation, behold the Self (supreme) in the self (intellect) by the self (purified mind); others by the Yoga of knowledge, and yet others by the Yoga of action."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.26,"Those who may not know Me by other means, if worshipping Me as they have heard from others, they too go beyond death by their devotion to what they have heard."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.27,"Whatever is born, unmoving or moving, O Arjuna, know it to be from the union of the field and its knower.
"
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.28,"He who beholds the imperishable Supreme Lord, existing equally in all perishable beings, realizes the truth."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.29,"Because he who sees the same Lord existing everywhere does not destroy the Self by the self (intellect); therefore, he goes to the highest goal (is released from the round of birth and death)."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.30,"He is the real seer (or sage) who sees that all actions are performed by nature alone, and that the Self (Atman) is actionless."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.31,"When a man realizes that the whole variety of beings are residing in the One, and are an evolution from that One alone, then he becomes Brahman (united with the Supreme)."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.32,"The Supreme Self without beginning, without qualities, imperishable, though dwelling in the body, O Arjuna, neither acts nor is attached to any action."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.33,"As the all pervading ether (sky) is not affected, by reasons of subtlety, so the Self (soul) seated in the body is not affected."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.34,"Just as the one sun illuminates the whole world, so also the Lord of the field (Supreme Self) illuminates the whole field, O Arjuna."
Ksetra-Ksetrajna-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 13,Verse 13.35,"They who know through the eye of intuition, this distinction between the field and its knower and also perceive the liberation from the Nature of being, go to the Supreme."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.1,"The blessed Lord spoke: Now Arjuna, I shall expose to you the most supreme and highest of all the wisdom in this universe by which all the great sages in this universe have achieved the highest perfection."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.2,"By fully learning, understanding and practising this wisdom, these sages have become a part of Me. As a result, they are not born at the time of creation nor do they pass away at the time of destruction of the universe."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.3,"O Arjuna, you must realize that it is from Me that all creation steam. The great Brahma, The Lord of all creation acts as My womb when I plant the seed of creation from which all beings evolve."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.4,"The blessed Lord said:Dear Arjuna, know that whenever and wherever a being is born, I am his parents, that is, both his mother and father, who gave him life in this world."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.5,"Arjuna, that NATURE is made of three parts, namely: SATTVA (the light representing goodness); RAJAS (fire representing passion), and TAMAS (darkness representing evil). These bind down and limit the human mortal bodies from reaching true perfection and achieving the state of infinite Spirit and immortality."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.6,"Arjuna, understand these three natural elements: SATTVA, because it represents light and purity is a sign of good health, but binds the various beings in this world to worldly material happiness. This attachment also leads to lower knowledge, my friend."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.7,"RAJAS, dear Arjuna, is that natural element representing passion which leads to material and worldly attachment. Rajas is known to bind the Soul of mortal men to action."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.8,"But you should also know O Arjuna, that darkness and evil born out of the TAMAS GUNA, exists mainly because of the ignorance of man in this world. TAMAS creates laziness and dullness. One loses the value of time and no longer desires to work or to take part in constuctive action."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.9,"In reality O son of Kunti, SATTVA (or Goodness) binds one to happiness; RAJAS leads to attachment to action; and TAMAS (evil) leads one to be lazy, dull, unproductive and cause negligence due to one?s ignorance."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.10,"At times O Arjuna, the first element of nature, SATTVA, rules over the other two GUNAS (powers of nature) known as RAJAS and TAMAS. However, at times the RAJAS part of human nature takes over and rules the SATTVA and TAMAS elements and similarly the TAMAS mode of nature may overpower the SATTVA and RAJAS modes of nature."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.11,"When the light of true knowledge and wisdom sorrounds and comes forth from one?s body, it is a sign that the SATTVA state of nature has occupied the body and taken over the person?s body, evidenced by his good actions (therefore he is known as a SATTVIC person)."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.12,"When the RAJAS GUNA has taken over a being, then it can be seen through a person?s excessive greed, lust, unrest, activity and other similar action (therefore the person is known to be RAJAS)."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.13,"Dullness, inactivity, laziness, negligence, ignorance, and sheer delusion about the world are all signs that the TAMAS elements have taken control of the person?s actions, behaviour, and thinking."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.14,"If a being is SATTVIC at the time that his soul departs from his body, his soul goes to the purest regions of the universe where truth and goodness prevail. He is therefore reborn at these same, pure regions of the earth O Arjuna."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.15,"Should a person be in the RAJAS state at the time of death, he is reborn in the places of the world where he is restless and constantly active. Similarly if a person is TAMASIC at the time of his death, he is reborn into a family of irrational behaviour, laziness and dullness."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.16,"The purity of SATTVA is characterized by the rewards that come out of good actions. However, the fruits of work that is done in the RAJAS state brings nothing but pain to a person; and work that is done in the TAMAS state, bears fruits of dullness and ignorance."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.17,"From the SATTVIC state of human nature one receives wisdom, from the RAJAS state arises greed, and form TAMAS evolves dullness and ignorance."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.18,"Those who are in the SATTVA state always follow the highest path or level of wisdom and intelligence; those who are in the RAJAS state always follow the middle level of intelligence and wisdom; and those who are under the influence of TAMAS from of human nature, always stoop to the lowest level of wisdom and knowledge and continually sink downwards along this path of ignorance."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.19,"When a true wiseman and seer fully understands that these three parts of nature are virtually the three main stages of life in this vast universe, he begins to also realize that which lies beyond these three conditions of nature, that is Myself. Thus once this is realized by any being they become an eternal part of Me the SUPREME LORD."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.20,"A person whose soul has risen above these three conditions of nature that actually lie within the mortal body, he becomes free from the cycle of birth and death as well as from sorrow and temporary happiness. He then enters into Me and thus becomes immortal."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.21,"Arjuna then asked the Almighty Lord:How can one know if a particular being has gone beyond or has transcended the three powers of nature O Krishna? What is his way of life and how does he manage to reach beyond the SATTVA, RAJAS, and TAMAS modes of nature?"
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.22,"My dear Pandava (Arjuna), he who does not hate nor has any desire for light, (representing results which are born out of SATTVIC deeds), busy activity, and all that represents darkness whether they are near to him or far from him?"
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.23,The Lord further explained:?He who sits apart undisturbed and unaffected by varying conditions of the environment and observes the world around him knowing and fully understanding that it is the power of nature that acts on all beings in this world?
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.24,"?? ??????? ???? ??? ??? ?????, ????-??? ?? ???? ????? ????, ??????, ????? ?? ?????? ??? ???? ??? ????, ??????, ????? ??? ?????? ?? ?? ?? ????? ???? ?? ???? ?????? ?????? ??? ?? ???? ??? ???? ?? ?"
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.25,He who behaves the same in times of honour or in times of disgrace; who behaves the same with enemies and friends; and who has surrendered all desires for action as well as lust for rewards resulting from those actions.
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.26,"And he who serves Me with an unfailing devotion, he is fit for becoming Brahman because he is gone beyond all the qualities (Gunas)."
Gunatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 14,Verse 14.27,"I am the abode of Brahman, the immortal, the immutable, the eternal (ever-lasting) dharma and absolute bliss."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.1,"The Dear Lord explained to Arjuna:O Arjuna, there exists an enormous, everlasting, and divinely pure tree known as the indestructable ASVAATTHAM (COSMIC TREE OF LIFE). The extraordinary things about this tree, is that it has its roots above at its peak and its branches are located at the lowest part of the tree. It?s pure, green leaves are the VEDAS (Holy Scriptures and Sacred Songs). He who believes and realizes this truth, also knows and understands the VEDAS."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.2,"Its branches extend both below and above, form the earth to heaven (and vice-versa). It is the great powers of nature that nourish the tree and give it life. Its ouds represent the sensual objects that inspire pleasure in all beings. The roots that stretch a far distance downward (from the heavens) into the world of man are bounded as firmly to the earth as man is bound to the mortal world because of his selfish actions and lust for material rewards."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.3,"Man cannot see this celestial tree nor even perceive its greatness. Man cannot see its changing forms nor its beginning, its end, nor its foundations. The only way one may be able to free oneself from the roots of this tree (which have spread and created this world of material attachment), is to cut free from these roots with the mighty sword of non-attachment."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.4,"If a man finds and proceeds along this path of non-attachment, he can say that he has truly discovered the way by which he can attain peaceful refuge and shelter in the Eternal Spirit (the Great beginning of all things is form whom all creation has evolved (namely, LORD KRISHNA Himself)."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.5,"A man whose thinking is pure and consists of no evil; a man who has totally freed himself from the bondages of pride and delusion; who has broken free from the chains of attachment and all material desires; who has surrendered all selfish desires; who has learned to direct full concentration of the mind on the Supreme Spirit; and who has liberated himself from the opposing feelings of pleasure and pain, always achieves a place in the divine and Eternal Abode (shelter) that is within Me, the Almighty."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.6,"That place upon which the sun cannot cast its glorious radiance, where the moon can shed no light, and where no fire, burns is what is known as My Supreme Abode. Here only the radiant light of My Eternal Glory shines. Those who reach this sacred destination, never return to suffer in this world again O Arjuna."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.7,"The Blessed Lord confided:O Arjuna, in this world, a certain fraction of My Eternal Spirit taken birth. This fragment of My Supreme Soul attracts the five senses plus an additional sixth one known as the mind and resides within the human body, in the realm of nature, on earth."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.8,"When I, the Lord of all the bodies that walk on this earth, enter a particular body. (and give it life and soul), and later when I leave this body (in the form of the body?s soul), I take the senses and the mind with Me and drift away like the wind that carries away sweet fragrances from their hidden sources within nature."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.9,"Therefore, O Arjuna, after I enter the body of a particular being in this world, as its soul, I bestow upon this being its five senses namely, its eyesight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, as well as its mind and furthermore it is because of Me that these senses function and stay operable. Thus, a being is able to experience the various objects in this world through his senses."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.10,"O Arjuna, only those people whose vision is clouded and whose mind is deluded are unable to see and realize Me as actually existing within them as their inner-selves and they do not realize that I am a part of human nature itself, whether or not I stay or depart from within them."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.11,"Those people who are pure at heart and are constantly striving to see Me, inevitably see Me, the Lord who dwells in their own heart. However those people who are impure at heart and in their minds never perceive Me, the Supreme Spirit, no matter how much they strive."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.12,"The Blessed Lord spoken in His Divine Voice: Arjuna, you should realize and always remember that the beautiful and overwhelming light that comes from the sun and illuminates the whole universe, the soft and splendrous light that is emitted by the moon, and the radiant glow of a fire, all come from within Me and exist because of me alone."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.13,"Upon entering into this world from the Heavens, O Arjuna, it is My Divine Energy that gives life and support to all things on this earth. As such, My Glory is so Divine and Beautiful that I become the Sacred Some plant that nourishes all the other plants and herbs on this earth. (The Soma or Moon plant, as it is literally translated, contains syrup that is considered to be very nourishing and healthy.)"
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.14,"O Arjuna, at the same time, I also become the fire of life that exists in all things that breathe on this earth. Together, with the fiery breaths of life that flow in and flow out of body, I burn and digest the four kinds of pure foods on this earth, while residing in a being?s body."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.15,"O Arjuna, at the same time, I also become the fire of life that exists in all things that breathe on this earth. Together, with the fiery breaths of life that flow in and flow out of body, I burn and digest the four kinds of pure foods on this earth, while residing in a being?s body."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.16,"There are two souls or spirits in this universe O Arjuna, namely, the destructible and indestructible. The destructible are all the those souls that are living in this universe and the indestructible are those souls that can never be subjected to change and are steady in their devotion to Me (therefore achieving immortality)."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.17,"However dear Arjuna, there is another spirit that is the highest of all spirits and it is called the Supreme Spirit. The Supreme Spirit is none other than Me, the Eternal and Omniscient (existing everywhere) Lord who supports this entire universe."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.18,"Lord Krishna explained:Because I am beyond all perishable objects on earth and because I even surpass all that is imperishable, I am known throughout the world and in all the Holy Scriptures (Vedas), as the Supreme and Divine Spirit."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.19,"He who has a clear vision and is constantly occupied with only divine and pure thoughts, comes to immediately realize that I am the Highest and most Superior Being in this universe. He who truly realize this fact knows all that is to be known in this world and thus he worships Me, with all his might and soul."
Purushottama Yoga,Chapter 15,Verse 15.20,"Dear Arjuna, I have thus revealed to you, the most secret and most sacred of all teachings in this world. By fully knowing and understanding this secret My Dear Devotee, any man can truly see the Divine Light of wisdom and he, thus, will have fulfilled all his tasks and duties in this world."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.1,"All of the significant qualities in all beings such as: freedom from fear, purity of mind and heart, stability in knowledge and concentration, generosity in charity, self-control, sacrifice, constant study of the holy Scriptures, piousness and straightforwardness."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.2,"?Non-violence, truth, freedom from anger, detachment from all things, peacefulness (with mind and self), restraint from finding faults with others, compassion towards all living beings, detachment from greedy craving, gentleness, modesty, and stability of the mind and emotions."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.3,"Vigour, an attitude of forgiveness towards others, courage, purity, goodwill, towards others, and freedom from pride. All of these, dear Arjuna, are considered by Me to be the great characteristics of a man who possesses a divine nature and has come into this world from heaven."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.4,"Characteristics such as deceitfulness, arrogance, excessive pride, anger, harshness, rudeness and ignorance are the makings of a man who has been born on to this earth from fiery hell."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.5,"The qualities that exist within a person with a divine nature, leads that person to a blissful freedom and liberation from this world and all its material objects. However the evil traits that are found in a person with a demonic nature, blinds that person to this world and to the sensual objects it contains. But grieve not, beloved Devotee of Mine, you have been born with a divine personality and your final and ultimate destination is heaven."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.6,"There are basically two types of beings in this world O Arjuna. The first type is known to have a pure, pious and divine nature. The second however, has a demonic and evil nature. I have explained the divine nature to you in great length, O Arjuna. Now listen dear friend . as I describe the nature of the corrupt and evil and evil-doers in this world."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.7,"Evil men O Partha. do not know the difference between what should and should not be done. Neither purity nor good conduct, nor even a single sign of truth exists in their hearts."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.8,Men of this evil nature generally say that this world has no truth; is without a basis for morality and good-will; that no Lord exists and that nobody should show any love or devotion to Him; that there is no regular sequence (or law) of creation; and that birth is only the result of a natural union (of man and woman) and comes about due to pure lust and nothing else.
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.9,"Standing firmly by these and other wrong beliefs throughout their lives, these evil men (whose souls have become corrupt and lost), show very little intelligence and are constantly absorbed in performing their evil tasks and wrong-doings. These demonic people are the enemies of this world and its people, and are leading it to total destruction."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.10,"These corrupt beings darken their souls by surrendering to obsessive and unending evil desires. They are full of deceit, false pride and stubborness. They strongly support and encourage their evil views and continue to execute their corrupt and impure tasks."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.11,"These evil-doers become obsessed with their several evil concerns and corrupt desires which remain with them all of their lives until their death. The highest goal in their lives (that is constantly on their minds), is the attainment of sensual enjoyment and material happiness in life and nothing else matters to them."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.12,The Blessed Lord described: They are bound to this world by hundreds of vain desires and hopes. They are obsessed with anger and lust. They also use unfair and often criminal means to gain enormous natural wealth in order to satisfy their neverending cravings to possess material items.
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.13,"It is common to hear people utter such things in their conversations as: ?I have gained this today, and I shall attain this desires later. This wealth belongs to me and more wealth shall also soon be mine.?"
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.14,"The Great Lord continued to describe the thinking of the Rakshasas (demons): It is also common to hear them say:?I have destroyed this enemy to mine and in a short time, my other enemies shall also be removed from my path of enjoyment in life. I am a Lord and the only Lord. Life is mine to enjoy as I wish. I am successful, powerful and content in life.?"
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.15,"?I am wealthy and come from a very well-to-do and quite noble family. Who else in the world can compare to my greatness? I shall sacrifice during religious rituals (whether I believe in them or not).I shall give to various charities (to be celebrated as a great supporter of these charities) I shall thoroughly enjoy life as I please.?This, O Arjuna, is what people who are in a deluded,confused and corrupted state say.These peole who are confused by many foul thoughts and evil influences, entangled in the net of unending darkness and obsessive desires for material gains, they are blackened souls who fall down into a foul hell in the end."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.16,?I am wealthy and come from a very well-to-do and quite noble family. Who else in the world can compare to my greatness? I shall sacrifice during religious rituals (whether I believe in them or not).
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.17,"In their moments of extreme pride and glory, when their minds are clouded up by the intoxication of their (temporary) material possessions, and while having wrong intentions, they perform their sacrifices. They perform the sacrificial rituals for the sake of show disregarding all the divine laws of sacrifice."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.18,"These evil beings are bound forever to their chains of selfishness, pride, arrogance, violence, anger and lust, These malicious men even despise Me, the true Lord of the Universe, who dwells even in their bodies and in those also with whom they associate."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.19,"hese devilish people who are cruel, whose soul is filled with hate, and who are among the worst men on earth, are ultimately thrown into destruction by Me the Supporter of all that is pure and who represents goodness in this world. O Arjuna, these people constantly remain in this vast cycle of constant birth and rebirth."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.20,"Furthermore, they are reborn into lower life forms and into currupt and evil families. They do not attain the highest state which is refuge in Me, O Arjuna, Instead, they choose to take the darker, lower path which leads to hell."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.21,"O Arjuna, there are three entrances or gateways to hell, all leading to the death of the self. These particular gates are known as the gateways of lust, anger, and greed. Man should avoid these gateways all his life or he shall inevitably suffer in hell after his death."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.22,"O son of Kunti, should a man free himself from these three doors, to hell, darkness and destruction, he discovers what is best for his inner spirit (or soul). He then ultimately reaches the highest goal by following the Supreme Path which leads to union with Me, the Supreme Spirit."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.23,"But, he who rejects and chooses not to follow the words of the Holy Scriptures (Vedas), and surrenders to his impulses and obsessive material desires, never attains perfection. Nor does he realize everlasting joy or peace, and most of all never discovers the Supreme Pathway which leads to My heart."
Daivasura-Sampad-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 16,Verse 16.24,"Therefore, O Pandava, regard the Holy Vedas as a guide to what is right and what is incorrect. Fully understand the words in these sacred writings, and most of all in this life, dutifully perform your responsibilities and work in their entirety."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.1,"Arjuna asked the Lord: What becomes of those people who do not obey the rules outlined by the Holy Scriptures yet perform ritual sacrifices with great faith and devotion? Are these people considered Saatvic (representing good), Rajas (representing passionate activity) or Tamas (immersed in total darkness and evil)?"
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.2,"The Blessed Lord said: O Arjuna, man possesses three kinds of faith that are born from his nature and these are: faith born out of light and goodness; faith born out of fire, or passion; faith that is born out of darkness or dullness. Now my dear devotee and friend, I shall describe all of the faiths."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.3,"The faith of every individual on earth O Arjuna is determined by their own nature. Man is made up of his own faith. Whatever a man?s faith is, in reality, that is what he is."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.4,"Beings who are pure in heart and mind, who are good- natured and believe in following the path of light, these people worship the Gods of light. Individuals who are constantly active in earning material wealth and power and those people who constantly indulge in sin and corruption while living in evil darkness, worship the evil spirits."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.5,"Those men who are selfish, corrupt, conceited, and false; whose actions are totally controlled by lust and passion; who perform terrible rituals that are forbidden by the Holy Scriptures."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.6,"and those who foolishly suppress the pure and natural life-giving powers within their bodies, as well as, at the same time, torture Me, who lives within their bodies; Arjuna, understand that the minds of these particular beings are filled with nothing but darkness and evil."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.7,"O Arjuna, even one of the most important necessities in life for all beings, namely food, belongs under three categories. Similarly, customs such as religious sacrifices, all acts of self-discipline, and self-restraint as well as the giving of gifts, can all be individually placed under three separate divisions."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.8,"For the man who is pure in heart and mind, the only foods that are dear to Him are pure foods that promote good health, mental power and physical strength, vitality, joy and cheerfulness in life. These are foods which have good taste, that are soothing and nourishing for the body, and which makes a man?s heart content."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.9,"The foods that appeal to the passionate people are those that are sour, bitter, salty, spicy, dry, very warm, painful (to eat), and at times cause pain and sickness after they are consumed."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.10,"Those people who strive on darkness and evil, eat foods that are impure, often stale and tasteless, rotten, lacking in freshness, and generally unfit to use during Holy offerings to Me."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.11,"A pure sacrifice is one where the religious offerings (made to Myself, the Almighty) are made with true love and adoration for Me. They are offerings that are made in accordance with the rules or Holy laws in our religious scriptures, with no expectation of rewards resulting from the performance of these sacrifices, and offerings that are made from the heart and only with the intention that it is one?s duty to perform this religious sacrifice."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.12,"However, O Bharata, a sacrifice that is done purely with the intention of receiving some reward, or done for the sake of display, is known as a Rajas sacrifice, which is an impure sacrifice."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.13,"Finally, My dear Devotee, the lowest type of sacrifice that exists is that which is performed by those that have darkened their inner-beings and are known to be of the dull, Tamas nature. When Tamas-nature people make sacrificial offerings, it is generally not in accordance with the holy rules of sacrifice, no gifts of pure food are distributed (Prashadam), no holy hymns are chanted, and the sacrifice is performed with no religious faith in Me whatsoever."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.14,"The worship of the Gods of Light; of the twice-born; worship and respect given to the religious teacher and the wise; worship and respect for all that is pure and true, all that represents justice and righteousness, virginity and non-violence, all of this brings tranquility and harmony to the body."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.15,"Speaking only those words which do not offend other beings, words which are truthful, pleasant, beautiful. beneficial and above all, words that exist only in the Holy Scriptures (Vedas), represent the harmony of speech."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.16,"Peace and tranquility of the mind, harmony and confidence in oneself, love, caring and gentleness towards others, and purity of the heart, are all the elements which create harmony of the mind."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.17,"If these three types of harmony are practised with supreme faith, a pure heart, truthful intentions, without any desire for rewards, and with a balanced mind and a peaceful soul, this is considered to be pure and total harmony and a definite sign that a person has chosen to follow the Saatvic path of light and ?goodness.?"
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.18,"However, My best of friend, he who falsely performs self-discipline and restraint purely for the sake of reputation, high honour, and for show, is considered to be impure and of the Rajas (passionate) nature. This type of self-restraint is unstable and lasts only temporarily."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.19,"When self-control is incorrectly performed by a dull person and results simply in self-torture for the person who is trying to restrain himself, or when it is performed for the sake of causing injury to another person, then this self-control leads to nowhere but into sheer darkness and further along the path of the Tamas Guna."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.20,"O Arjuna, hear now that what I have to say about gifts: A pure gift is that which is given with purity and kindness in the heart, given to the right person at the right time, given in the proper place, and above all when we expect nothing in return for the gift."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.21,"However Arjuna, when the gift is given with the expectation of receiving something in return, when it is also given for the sake of receiving future rewards or when the gift is given unwillingly from one person to another, this gift is considered impure and presented by a person of the Rajas nature."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.22,"A gift that is given to an unworthy (evil) person, at an improper time and place, given not from kindness in the heart, but with feelings of extreme pride and with contempt towards the other person, this gift, O Arjuna, is one that has evolved from darkness and has come from a person who is of the Tamas nature."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.23,"AUM, TAT, SAT (literal translation: the Lord who is the truth). Dear Partha, each one of these sacred words represents the three stages of the Brahman (the Brahman is the single word that describes where all Brahmins (spiritual teachers) have originated from). From the Brahman also evolved the Holy Scriptures (Vedas) and is today also known as the Supreme Spiritual Sacrifice."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.24,"Therefore, dear Arjuna, he who is a devoted follower of the Brahman, begins all acts of spiritual sacrifice, gift-giving, or self-perfection (which is really the achievement of inner-peace with the self), with the word Aum (Aum or the Lord is the very beginning of all things in the universe)."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.25,"The word Tat describes the actual performance of the Spiritual Sacrifice, the presentation of gifts, and all acts of self perfection and self-harmony. The performance of these acts (by those who seek true, infinite liberty from the world), without wishing for any rewards in return are done by the true followers of the Brahman, in accordance with the Holy laws, as stated in the Scriptures. If these acts are done properly, they lead a person further along the path towards Me, the Supreme Goal and Supreme Spirit."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.26,"Sat (derived from term Satya), is the word that literally means Supreme Truth and goodness. It is the end or final step in the actual Spiritual sacrifice and signifies the ultimate or final goal to be reached at the end of performing this religious ritual namely, to please Me in order to attain unity with Me. Since I am the Supreme Truth, O Arjuna, when a particular (religious) task is performed and has been properly completed, the result of this spiritual work is the attainment of the Supreme Truth or the attainment of Myself, the Lord."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.27,"Everlasting faithfulness is Spiritual Sacrifice, Self-harmony, and the giving of gifts, lead one on the pathway to achieving Sat, O Arjuna. This is a fact because all of these divisions of faith ultimately lead to Me, the Eternal Truth."
Shraddhatraya-Vibhaga Yoga,Chapter 17,Verse 17.28,"If any of these acts, O Arjuna, whether it is Spiritual Sacrifice, Self-perfection or the offering of pure and pleasant gifts, is done without faith and good incentives, Asat (all that is untrue and representative of darkness) is attained. By achieving Asat, one has really gained absolutely nothing, O Son of Kunti, because I hold the acts performed in Asat as useless, and having no importance in this world or in the afterworld."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.1,"Arjuna asked the Almighty Krishna:Please explain to me, Dear Lord, what it means to have truly RENOUNCED (surrendered from a materialistic nature) in this life."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.2,"The Blessed Lord replied:If one entirely gives up all selfish motives, desires and actions, this is called true RENUNCIATION, and he who has given up all desires for rewards for all work he has accomplished, is considered by Me to have totally SURRENDERED from the material way of life."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.3,"It is common for some people to say that constant constructive action disturbs people from fully concentrating on the Lord and his many beautiful qualities. Therefore, all performance of any task or responsibility should be renounced as well. However, still, other people say that all actions except those done for sacrifice, self-harmony, or gift-giving, should be given up."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.4,"Now My Dear Disciple, listen to Me as I disclose to you the true secret of surrendering and abandonment of materialism in this world. O Best of Men, there are three kinds of abandonment in this world that have been declared in this world by Me."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.5,"Tasks which involve works of sacrifice, gift-giving, and self-improvement should never be abandoned and should always be performed. I consider these acts, O Arjuna, to be those of purification and all those who are wise realize this fact."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.6,"However, dear Arjuna, these works of purification should be performed with freedom from attachment to material goods and without expectation of any rewards resulting from these actions. This, O Partha, is My decided and final word."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.7,"The Blessed Lord Advised: O Arjuna, it would be unwise to leave the holy work that should be completed, unfinished, Such an abandonment of work and surrender from action is a sin and would be an act of darkness as well as delusion."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.8,"O Arjuna, he who abandons his duties because he fears that some discomfort or pain will come to him by performing these duties, is of the Rajas Guna (nature) and his way of surrendering from work is a sign of this nature within him. You must realize, O Arjuna, that person actually accomplishes nothing when he performs his various tasks."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.9,"But, O son of Kunti, he who partakes in these holy tasks, O Arjuna, only because he knows that it is his duty to accomplish them, and at the same time forsakes all selfish desires and thoughts of receiving rewards, is considered by Me to be a man of ?goodness.? Because of performing his pure work, this man produces only peace, divine joy, and other SAATVIC results."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.10,"This wiseman, whose doubts no longer exist, who has learned the real truth about renunciation in this world, is a pure and SAATVIC man of peace. Whether a particular task is pleasant or painful to perform, he receives joy from accomplishing it."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.11,"Understand, Best of Men (Arjuna), that a mortal being cannot easily surrender and abstain entirely from work in this world. But it is possible for a person to surrender himself totally, from desiring rewards from the work he accomplishes. In My eyes dear Arjuna, he who does this, is one who has truly renounced this material world."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.12,"When a man perform duties (or work) of any kind only for the sake of reward, the work at times either brings pleasure or certain occasions, pain. However dear Arjuna, he who does work for the sake of gaining Eternal Happiness (by union with Me), he undoubtfully receives this Eternal and Infinite Bliss."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.13,"O Mighty-armed Arjuna, learn and realize from Me the five causes of all the actions in this world as stated in the holy SAMKHYA (one of the philosophical teachings on the subject of KARMA in the VEDANTA) in which all the end results of all actions are found."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.14,"The Lord described the five causes of action: The body itself, is the first. The second is the owner of the body who actually performs the action. The third is the various senses of the body, which allow perception of the world. The fourth is the different functions performed by the being and finally the Super-Soul within the being."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.15,"Whether a being?s means of actions are his body, mind, or speech, all of his actions whether good or bad. are caused by these five factors."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.16,"Therefore dear Arjuna, He who looks upon himself as the doer of all his actions, disregarding all of the five actual causes of action, has clouded vision, deluded intelligence, and cannot see things as they really are."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.17,"He who is free from the bondages of selfishness, and is rid of all ill thoughts, and desires, even if he kills others in this world, he is not actually killing them (because he, in effect, is carrying out his prescribed duty which is actually the predetermined will of God). This person is not bound to this world by his actions in any way whatsoever, O Arjuna."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.18,"rjuna, there are three instigators (stimuli) of action in this world namely, knowledge itself (that which is perceived through the senses and interpreted by a being through his mind and intellect), the object of knowledge (that which a being uses to receive his knowledge and ultimately gains his intelligence from after he perceives the useful information through his senses), and of course the knower (who is the SELF or the JIVATMAN ? that which receives and is affected by the stimulus to perform the action of learning). The three factors involved in the accomplishment of any task are the senses, the actual work and the performer of the work."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.19,"Now Arjuna, listen as I tell you the different kinds of knowledge, types of work, and the different categories of workers, that have been stated in the terms outlined by the philosophies of the three modes of material nature."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.20,"When one can see Eternity, Infinity, and an undivided spiritual nature in things that are mortal, perishable, and divided in their spiritual nature, he has acquired the pure SAATVIC knowledge (or the knowledge of ?goodness,? concerning the spiritual soul beyond the body)."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.21,"However, Partha, if one can only see the multitude of things in this world in terms of their limitations and divisions, then this being possesses the impure knowledge of the Rajas mode of nature. (This passionately natured person possesses knowledge that is derived from many theories, teachings, mental logic, and speculation that exist in this world)."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.22,"However dear Arjuna, if one selfishly views one particular thing (namely the body) as if it is all and everything that is to be concerned about, the knowledge he possesses does not allow him to see beyond the perishable objects and beings in this world. He considers himself the one and only, independent, and seperate from all other beings in this world."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.23,"The Blessed Lord explained: When work is done as if it were a sacred task, Without any selfish, motives, with a peaceful mind, without any feelings of lust and hate, and without any desire for rewards, I consider this work to be pure and SATTVIC."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.24,"But when any task is completed with selfish desires in mind, looked upon as an effort and nothing more, looked upon as if it was a great sacrifice to have completed a task, this type of work is impure and only performed by Rajas-natured people."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.25,"The work which one completes with a confused mind and deluded intelligence, without any cares about the horrible consequences that might result from his selfish tasks; work that is done without concern for the bondage that it creates for the performer; work done without any heed to injury or harm that might come to others because of one?s (evil) actions; or work accomplished without worrying about one?s own loss; these are work done out of darkness by those who are known as Tamsic-natured people."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.26,"A man who is free from the bondages of selfish and material attachments, who is without a false ego, unaffected by material desires or the fluctuations between success and failure, and who has enthusiasm, is said to be a man of the Saatvic-nature and in the mode of goodness."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.27,"The worker who is over-attached to his work and activity, and to the results of his work, who wants to enjoy the good results, who is always jealous of the other?s possessions, is selfish, greedy, violent, impure, and who is affected by both pleasure and pain, is a man of the impure, Rajas-nature."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.28,"A person whose behaviour is marked by ignorance, conceit, vulgarity, deceit, maliciousness, offence to others, laziness, without self-harmony, procrastination, materialism, and speaking and doing things against the Holy Scriptures, is said to be a man who possesses the dark and ignorant Tamas-personality."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.29,"Now Arjuna, hear and understand as I reveal to you the three divisions of wisdom and stability of the mind, according to the three GUNAS (modes of nature)."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.30,"Pure and SAATVIC wisdom, O Partha, is that which one possesses when one knows when to go to a certain point and when to return; what should and should not be done; what fear is and what courage is; and who recognizes the difference between bondage to this world and freedom from it."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.31,"The wisdom which is characterized by a lack of understanding of what should and should not be done; between what is religious and non-religious activity; between what is right and wrong; and when a person constantly mistakes action to be performed, with action not to be performed, that person has impure, passionate, or Rajas wisdom."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.32,"O Arjuna, there is wisdom obscured in darkness and ignorance. A being possesses this TAMAS reasoning if he thinks that wrong is right; if he is always under illusions and misconceptions about truths in this world, and considers religious tasks and devilish tasks to be one and the same."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.33,"O Partha, while practising Yoga and full concentration on Me (who resides in the soul of every being), unbreakable determination and stability of mind is developed and sustained. The practice of YOGA harmoniously balances the mind and a being?s every breath of life. This pure STEADINESS and stability is known to be found in those who are of the SAATVIC- natured."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.34,"But Arjuna, he who uses his steadiness only for the purpose of gaining fruits and rewards in areas that involve both his personal, financial money matters and religious rituals, possesses the steadiness of passion. This impure determination and stability of the mind is common to those who have the RAJAS GUNA within them."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.35,"That steadiness which cannot overcome unreality. fearfulness, laziness, depression, lust, illusion, and self-pity, is foolish steadiness and is undoubtedly one belonging the dark TAMAS-nature."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.36,"Now great Arjuna, I will disclose to you the three types of pleasure that exist in this world. There is a divine and pure pleasure that one receives from following the righteous path of ?Light and Goodness.? This path leads to the end of all hardship.
The Blessed Lord Spoke: O Arjuna, that which in the beginning may seem to be the cup of sorrow but is found in the end to be the cup of sweet nectar, refreshes one to the state of self-realization. This, My Dear Devotee, is pure pleasure and happiness which allows one to clearly see and feel Me, the Spirit within their hearts. This pleasure is known as the SAATVIC pleasure, O Arjuna."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.37,"That which is like poison at first, but in the end like nectar, that pleasure is declared to be SATTVIC (pure) born of the purity of ones own mind due to Self realisation."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.38,"However O Arjuna, pleasure which is derived immediately from the contact of the senses with their objects, appears to the human senses as the sweet nectar at first, but later it is discovered to be nothing more than poison to one?s own being. This pleasure is known as the Rajas pleasure of passion."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.39,"That type of pleasure which blinds one to the path leading to true self-harmony and self-realization, both in the beginning as well as in the end, is known as the TAMAS pleasure. This pleasure is derived from drowziness, laziness, carelessness and illusion. Instead of bringing divine happiness to the soul, it deludes the soul and darkness surrounds it."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.40,"Nothing exists, either on the face of this earth or among the Demi- gods in heaven, which is free from the three powers of nature, dear Bharata,"
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.41,"O Arjuna, all the different qualities of work of the various casts in society, namely the Brahmins, Kshastriyas, Vaisyas, and Sudras are determined according to the three modes of nature."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.42,"Now, O Arjuna, let Me describe to you all of these individual members of society: The works of the Brahmins are characterized by such qualities as, peacefulness, self-control, purity, tolerance, honesty, faith, righteousness,and wisdom."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.43,"The valiant work of the Kshastriyas are marked by their heroic minds, power, resourcefulness, determination, courage in battle, generosity in charity and noble leadership."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.44,"The Vaisyas and the Sudras are known to provide the services of farming, rearing cattle, and agricultural trade for society."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.45,"All of these people who are the various components that make up society, attain the truest state of perfection when they perform their work while at the same time find great joy and happiness in performing their designated tasks."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.46,"They all reach perfection while performing their various designated tasks in society and of course by worship of the Lord, who is the maker and source of all existence (and beyond) in this world. O Arjuna, listen carefully now as I explain how a man achieves perfection while still finding joy in his duties and other work in this world."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.47,"O Arjuna, it is far better to perform one?s own tasks imperfectly rather than to perform someone else?s tasks with perfection. When a man does the work that is prescribed to him, no sins or sinful desires can affect this man."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.48,"A man should never foresake his own tasks, even if he cannot complete them in full perfection, simply because it is a known fact that every (human) endeavour consists of some fault or imperfection just as all fire consists of smoke."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.49,"When a man?s ultimate goal is to achieve freedom from material bondage in this world, and his soul is divine and in pure harmony, he can attain the results of RENUNCIATION (detachment from material objects) which thus, leads him to the Supreme Region of Peace, Happiness and Bliss, which is with Me, in glorious heaven."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.50,"Hear now, Arjuna, as I reveal to you how one reaches the highest and most perfect stage of renunciation known as the BRAHMAN."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.51,"When one possesses clear reasoning abilities, control of the mind, pure determination, and a divine soul; when he has totally given up all the objects that bring pleasure to his senses; whose spirit has risen beyond the emotional states of passion and hate."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.52,"?He who lives in solitude and secluded silence; who eats only the absolutely necessary quantities of food (for survival); who partakes in steady meditation and concentration on the Supreme Spirit; whose thoughts, speech, and bodily movements are under constant control."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.53,"?who does not let passion control his will; who is rid of his greed, violence and pride; whose feelings of anger and lust are abolished; who has broken free from the bondages of all his material possessions; and who treats all other fellow beings in this world equally; a being who possesses all such qualities has reached the highest state of self-realization possible, namely that which is the Brahman, which is in the heart of the Lord."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.54,"This being becomes one with God (or the Supreme Brahman), and his soul experiences true joy, peace and bliss. He no longer feels any desire for material things nor does he recognize any grief. He extends his love to all creation in this world and shows supreme love and unfailing devotion to Me, the Lord of all."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.55,"One can only fully understand Me, the Supreme Spirit, as I truly am, by pouring out his pure love and devotion to Me. When this being has truly realized and understood Me, in the end, he enters into and becomes a part of Me, the Supreme Soul."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.56,"While engaged in whatever task a person has been prescribed, a person can task refuge in Me, and with My Divine Grace and Protection, a person, can easily reach the most Supreme and Eternal Abode where I reside."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.57,"O Arjuna, if one truly offers and dedicates, with his heart, all of his actions to Me, depending on Me for the results of his actions; realizes that the results of his actions lie in My hands alone; sees Me as the ultimate result of his love, devotion and meditation, in the end his soul combines with Mine for eternity."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.58,"O Arjuna, a person who constantly fixes all his thoughts and meditations upon Me, by My Grace, overcomes all the dangers and difficulties, that he encounters in his lifetime. However, he who constantly only thinks about himself, develops a false ego, and does not heed My Divine Words of Wisdom, is lost and eventually shall perish."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.59,"If you do not fight the battle which you are destined to fight and you disobey My instructions, I shall consider this act to be one of extreme vanity and misguidance. However, O Son of Kunti, you will be impelled into warfare with your enemies by your very own nature."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.60,"Although you do not want to accomplish your prescribed task, O Arjuna, you will undoubtedly be driven by your own personality and good nature to perform your designated duty. You will also act out My wishes and perform the task ahead of you, O Arjuna, because of your bondage to KARMA (constructive action) in your past life."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.61,"The Blessed Lord explained: O Arjuna, God dwells in the hearts of all beings just as He dwells in your heart. With His Almighty power, He moves and directs all living things in this world as if they were sitting on a machine that was moving them through time."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.62,"O Son of Kunti, willingly surrender your life and soul unto HIM. O Bharata, seek Him only for refuge and salvation and you shall have achieved eternal peace and bliss in His Supreme abode."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.63,"O Arjuna, I have revealed to you My words of wisdom and holy advice. Give serious thought and consideration to the divine words that I have spoken unto you. They are Eternal Truths of life and the after-life, and are not hidden mysteries of any kind. However Arjuna, I can only preach and guide you to the Light of Wisdom. It is up to you alone to abide by My teachings."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.64,"O Arjuna, because of My deep love and respect for you, your friendship and your devotion to Me. I will reveal to you once more, the most confidential portion of My Divine Knowledge. Hear these words once more O Arjuna, because they will lead you to salvation and Eternal Happiness."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.65,"Devote your heart, mind, religious sacrifices and prayers to Me for eternity O Partha, and you shall, without fail, become a part of Me forever. This is My promise to you, My devotee."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.66,"Detach yourself from all worldly things O Arjuna, and reach out to Me for your salvation and liberation from this world. I shall always protect you from all the worldly sins you may encounter. Put your full love, trust, and devotion in me and you shall fear nothing."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.67,"The Blessed Lord urged: Do not, O Partha, explain My teachings to those who lack self-discipline; who lack love and devotion towards Me; who do not believe in Me; and who argue against My divine words of Wisdom."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.68,"However O Bharata, he who preaches My divine teachings to those who show true love and devotion to Me and who, themselves, are eternally devoted to Me, in the end, they shall also become a part of Me."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.69,"There exists no man among men in this world who can do a greater service to Me than to extend My words of wisdom and eternal truths to those who are worthy of hearing them. O Arjuna, I hold this man to be very dear to My heart."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.70,"The Blessed Lord Krishna declared: He who studies and truly learns this sacred conversation, O Partha, worships Me through his intelligence and light of wisdom."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.71,"He who only listen to this conversation, has faith in Me, is detached from sinful activities and has no doubt concerning Me or the divine words I utter, also attains blissful freedom from this world and in the end resides among only the pious and holy men."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.72,"Have you heard these words of wisdom My Dear Devotee, with your mind at perfect concentration and with silence in your soul? Have you truly rid yourself of the darkness of your delusion? Has it been replaced by the inner light of wisdom, O Arjuna."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.73,"Arjuna replied to the Almighty Krishna: By your wonderful Grace, Dear Lord and Master of the Universe, I have discovered this light in my mind and soul. My illusions no longer remain with Me. My faith in You is strong, O Great Lord Krishna. I shall devote my very life to following your advice and instructions."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.74,"Sanjaya concluded: Thus my dear King, I have recited to you the very same sacred conversation of the Lord of Lords and His Faithful Devotee, Arjuna. The messages that I have recounted to you, my King, fill me with awe, wonder and excitement."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.75,"By the kindness of the Holy poet, Ved O?Vyas, I have heard these most confidential and sacred of conversations spoken by Lord Krishna himself, Master of all that exists in this universe, and His devoted follower Arjuna."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.76,"The more I recall these glorious words, my King, the more my heart is filled with unending joy, pleasure, and excitement."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.77,"O My King, whenever I remember that most beautiful and divine vision of the Glorious Lord himself, I am struck with great amazement and wonder. My heart leaps with more joy and is filled with adoration for the Lord."
Moksha-Sanyasa Yoga,Chapter 18,Verse 18.78,"Wherever there is the Divine Lord Krishna, the Master of all Yoga, and the able disciple Arjuna, there is beauty, morality, extraordinary power, and victory over all evil. O King Dhrtarastra, this is my unshakeable belief and faith."
