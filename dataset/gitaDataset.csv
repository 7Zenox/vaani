"Arjun said: O Krishna, seeing my own kinsmen arrayed for battle here and intent on killing each other, my limbs are giving way and my mouth is drying up."
Bhagavad Gita 1.29  1.31
"My whole body shudders; my hair is standing on end. My bow, the G????v, is slipping from my hand, and my skin is burning all over. My mind is in quandary and whirling in confusion; I am unable to hold myself steady any longer. O Krishna, killer of the Keshi demon, I only see omens of misfortune. I do not foresee how any good can come from killing my own kinsmen in this battle."
Bhagavad Gita 1.32  1.33
"O Krishna, I do not desire victory, kingdom, or the happiness accruing to it. Of what avail will be a kingdom, pleasures, or even life itself, when the very persons for whom we covet them, are standing before us for battle?"
Bhagavad Gita 1.34  1.35
"Teachers, fathers, sons, grandfathers, maternal uncles, grandsons, fathers-in-law, grand-nephews, brothers-in-law, and other kinsmen are present here, staking their lives and riches. O Madhusudan, I do not wish to slay them, even if they attack me. If we kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, what satisfaction will we derive from the dominion over the three worlds, what to speak of this Earth?"
Bhagavad Gita 1.36  1.37
"O Maintainer of all living entities, what pleasure will we derive from killing the sons of Dhritarasthra? Even though they may be aggressors, sin will certainly come upon us if we slay them. Hence, it does not behoove us to kill our own cousins, the sons of Dhritarashtra, and friends. O Madhav (Krishna), how can we hope to be happy by killing our own kinsmen?"
Bhagavad Gita 1.38  1.39
"Their thoughts are overpowered by greed and they see no wrong in annihilating their relatives or wreaking treachery upon friends. Yet, O Janardan (Krishna), why should we, who can clearly see the crime in killing our kindred, not turn away from this sin?"

Bhagavad Gita 1.42
"An increase in unwanted children results in hellish life both for the family and for those who destroy the family. Deprived of sacrificial offerings, the ancestors of such corrupt families also fall."
Bhagavad Gita 1.43
"Through the evil deeds of those who destroy the family tradition and thus give rise to unwanted progeny, a variety of social and family welfare activities are ruined."
Bhagavad Gita 1.44
"O Janardan (Krishna), I have heard from the learned that those who destroy family traditions dwell in hell for an indefinite period of time."
Bhagavad Gita 1.45  1.46
"Alas! How strange it is that we have set our mind to perform this great sin with horrifying consequences. Driven by the desire for kingly pleasures, we are intent on killing our own kinsmen. It would be better if, with weapons in hand, the sons of Dhritarashtra kill me unarmed and unresisting on the battlefield."

Bhagavad Gita 2.14
"O son of Kunti, the contact between the senses and the sense objects gives rise to fleeting perceptions of happiness and distress. These are non-permanent, and come and go like the winter and summer seasons. O descendent of Bharat, one must learn to tolerate them without being disturbed."

"O Arjun, noblest amongst men, that person who is not affected by happiness and distress, and remains steady in both, becomes eligible for liberation."

"With their minds deeply attached to worldly pleasures and their intellects bewildered by such things, they are unable to possess the resolute determination for success on the path to God."
Bhagavad Gita 2.45
"The Vedas deal with the three modes of material nature, O Arjun. Rise above the three modes to a state of pure spiritual consciousness. Freeing yourself from dualities, eternally fixed in Truth, and without concern for material gain and safety, be situated in the self."

Bhagavad Gita 2.61
"They are established in perfect knowledge, who subdue their senses and keep their minds ever absorbed in Me."
Bhagavad Gita 2.62
"While contemplating on the objects of the senses, one develops attachment to them. Attachment leads to desire, and from desire arises anger."

"Anger leads to clouding of judgment, which results in bewilderment of memory. When memory is bewildered, the intellect gets destroyed; and when the intellect is destroyed, one is ruined."
Bhagavad Gita 2.64

Bhagavad Gita 2.66
"But an undisciplined person, who has not controlled the mind and senses, can neither have a resolute intellect nor steady contemplation on God. For one who never unites the mind with God there is no peace; and how can one who lacks peace be happy?"
Bhagavad Gita 2.67
"Just as a strong wind sweeps a boat off its chartered course on the water, even one of the senses on which the mind focuses can lead the intellect astray."
Bhagavad Gita 2.68
"Therefore, one who has restrained the senses from their objects, O mighty armed Arjun, is firmly established in transcendental knowledge."
Bhagavad Gita 2.69
"What all beings consider as day is the night of ignorance for the wise, and what all creatures see as night is the day for the introspective sage."
Bhagavad Gita 2.70
"Just as the ocean remains undisturbed by the incessant flow of waters from rivers merging into it, likewise the sage who is unmoved despite the flow of desirable objects all around him attains peace, and not the person who strives to satisfy desires."
Bhagavad Gita 2.71
"That person, who gives up all material desires and lives free from a sense of greed, proprietorship, and egoism, attains perfect peace."
Bhagavad Gita 2.72
"O Parth, such is the state of an enlightened soul that having attained it, one is never again deluded. Being established in this consciousness even at the hour of death, one is liberated from the cycle of life and death and reaches the Supreme Abode of God."

"There is no one who can remain without action even for a moment. Indeed, all beings are compelled to act by their qualities born of material nature (the three gu?as)."
Bhagavad Gita 3.6
"Those who restrain the external organs of action, while continuing to dwell on sense objects in the mind, certainly delude themselves and are to be called hypocrites."

Bhagavad Gita 3.15
"The duties for human beings are described in the Vedas, and the Vedas are manifested by God Himself. Therefore, the all-pervading Lord is eternally present in acts of sacrifice."
Bhagavad Gita 3.16
"O Parth, those who do not accept their responsibility in the cycle of sacrifice established by the Vedas are sinful. They live only for the delight of their senses; indeed their lives are in vain."
Bhagavad Gita 3.17
"But those who rejoice in the self, who are illumined and fully satisfied in the self, for them, there is no duty."
Bhagavad Gita 3.18

Bhagavad Gita 3.29
Those who are deluded by the operation of the gu?as become attached to the results of their actions. But the wise who understand these truths should not unsettle such ignorant people who know very little.

Bhagavad Gita 4.10
"Being free from attachment, fear, and anger, becoming fully absorbed in Me, and taking refuge in Me, many persons in the past became purified by knowledge of Me, and thus attained My divine love."
Bhagavad Gita 4.11
"In whatever way people surrender unto Me, I reciprocate accordingly. Everyone follows My path, knowingly or unknowingly, O son of Pritha."
Bhagavad Gita 4.12
"In this world, those desiring success in material activities worship the celestial gods, since material rewards manifest quickly."
Bhagavad Gita 4.13
"The four categories of occupations were created by Me according to people’s qualities and activities. Although I am the Creator of this system, know Me to be the Non-doer and Eternal."
Bhagavad Gita 4.14
"Activities do not taint Me, nor do I desire the fruits of action. One who knows Me in this way is never bound by the karmic reactions of work."
Bhagavad Gita 4.15
"Knowing this truth, even seekers of liberation in ancient times performed actions. Therefore, following the footsteps of those ancient sages, you too should perform your duty."
Bhagavad Gita 4.16
"What is action and what is inaction? Even the wise are confused in determining this. Now I shall explain to you the secret of action, by knowing which, you may free yourself from material bondage."
Bhagavad Gita 4.17
"You must understand the nature of all three—recommended action, wrong action, and inaction. The truth about these is profound and difficult to understand."
Bhagavad Gita 4.18
"Those who see action in inaction and inaction in action are truly wise amongst humans. Although performing all kinds of actions, they are yogis and masters of all their actions."
Bhagavad Gita 4.19
"The enlightened sages call those persons wise, whose every action is free from the desire for material pleasures and who have burnt the reactions of work in the fire of divine knowledge."
Bhagavad Gita 4.20
"Such people, having given up attachment to the fruits of their actions, are always satisfied and not dependent on external things. Despite engaging in activities, they do not do anything at all."
Bhagavad Gita 4.21
"Free from expectations and the sense of ownership, with the mind and intellect fully controlled, they incur no sin even though performing actions by their body."
Bhagavad Gita 4.22
"Content with whatever gain comes of its own accord, and free from envy, they are beyond the dualities of life. Being equipoised in success and failure, they are not bound by their actions, even while performing all kinds of activities."
Bhagavad Gita 4.23
"They are released from the bondage of material attachments and their intellect is established in divine knowledge. Since they perform all actions as a sacrifice (to God), they are freed from all karmic reactions."
Bhagavad Gita 4.24
"For those who are completely absorbed in God-consciousness, the oblation is Brahman, the ladle with which it is offered is Brahman, the act of offering is Brahman, and the sacrificial fire is also Brahman. Such persons, who view everything as God, easily attain Him."
Bhagavad Gita 4.25
Some yogis worship the celestial gods with material offerings unto them. Others worship perfectly who offer the self as sacrifice in the fire of the Supreme Truth.
Bhagavad Gita 4.26
Others offer hearing and other senses in the sacrificial fire of restraint. Still others offer sound and other objects of the senses as sacrifice in the fire of the senses.
Bhagavad Gita 4.27
"Some, inspired by knowledge, offer the functions of all their senses and their life energy in the fire of the controlled mind."
Bhagavad Gita 4.28
"Some offer their wealth as sacrifice, while others offer severe austerities as sacrifice. Some practice the eight-fold path of yogic practices, and yet others study the scriptures and cultivate knowledge as sacrifice, while observing strict vows."
Bhagavad Gita 4.29 – 4.30
"Still others offer as sacrifice the outgoing breath in the incoming breath, while some offer the incoming breath into the outgoing breath. Some arduously practice pr???y?m and restrain the incoming and outgoing breaths, purely absorbed in the regulation of the life-energy. Yet others curtail their food intake and offer the breath into the life-energy as sacrifice. All these knowers of sacrifice are cleansed of their impurities as a result of such performances."
Bhagavad Gita 4.31
"Those who know the secret of sacrifice, and engaging in it, partake of its remnants that are like nectar, advance toward the Absolute Truth. O best of the Kurus, those who perform no sacrifice find no happiness either in this world or the next."
Bhagavad Gita 4.32
All these different kinds of sacrifice have been described in the Vedas. Know them as originating from different types of work; this understanding cuts the knots of material bondage.
Bhagavad Gita 4.33
"O subduer of enemies, sacrifice performed in knowledge is superior to any mechanical material sacrifice. After all, O Parth, all sacrifices of work culminate in knowledge."
Bhagavad Gita 4.34
Learn the Truth by approaching a spiritual master. Inquire from him with reverence and render service unto him. Such an enlightened Saint can impart knowledge unto you because he has seen the Truth.
Bhagavad Gita 4.35
"Following this path and having achieved enlightenment from a Guru, O Arjun, you will no longer fall into delusion. In the light of that knowledge, you will see that all living beings are but parts of the Supreme, and are within Me."
Bhagavad Gita 4.36
Even those who are considered the most immoral of all sinners can cross over this ocean of material existence by seating themselves in the boat of divine knowledge.
Bhagavad Gita 4.37
"As a kindled fire reduces wood to ashes, O Arjun, so does the fire of knowledge burn to ashes all reactions from material activities."
Bhagavad Gita 4.38

"But persons who possess neither faith nor knowledge, and who are of a doubting nature, suffer a downfall. For the skeptical souls, there is no happiness either in this world or the next."
Bhagavad Gita 4.41
"O Arjun, actions do not bind those who have renounced karm in the fire of Yog, whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge, and who are situated in knowledge of the self."
Bhagavad Gita 4.42
"Therefore, with the sword of knowledge, cut asunder the doubts that have arisen in your heart. O scion of Bharat, establish yourself in karm yog. Arise, stand up, and take action!"
Bhagavad Gita 5.1View commentary »
"Arjun said: O Shree Krishna, You praised karm sany?s (the path of renunciation of actions), and You also advised to do karm yog (work with devotion). Please tell me decisively which of the two is more beneficial?"
Bhagavad Gita 5.2
The Supreme Lord said: Both the path of karm sany?s (renunciation of actions) and karm yog (working in devotion) lead to the supreme goal. But karm yog is superior to karm sany?s.
Bhagavad Gita 5.3
"The karm yogis, who neither desire nor hate anything, should be considered always renounced. Free from all dualities, they are easily liberated from the bonds of material energy."
Bhagavad Gita 5.4
"Only the ignorant speak of s?nkhya (renunciation of actions, or karm sany?s) and karm yog (work in devotion) as different. Those who are truly learned say that by applying ourselves to any one of these paths, we can achieve the results of both."
Bhagavad Gita 5.5
"The supreme state that is attained by means of karm sany?s is also attained by working in devotion. Hence, those who see karm sany?s and karm yog to be identical, truly see things as they are."
Bhagavad Gita 5.6
"Perfect renunciation (karm sany?s) is difficult to attain without performing work in devotion (karm yog), O mighty-armed Arjun, but the sage who is adept in karm yog quickly attains the Supreme."
Bhagavad Gita 5.7
"The karm yogis, who are of purified intellect, and who control the mind and senses, see the Soul of all souls in every living being. Though performing all kinds of actions, they are never entangled."
Bhagavad Gita 5.8 – 5.9
"Those steadfast in karm yog, always think, “I am not the doer,” even while engaged in seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, moving, sleeping, breathing, speaking, excreting, grasping, and opening or closing the eyes. With the light of divine knowledge, they see that it is only the material senses that are moving amongst their objects."
Bhagavad Gita 5.10
"Those who dedicate their actions to God, abandoning all attachment, remain untouched by sin, just as a lotus leaf is untouched by water."
Bhagavad Gita 5.11
"The yogis, while giving up attachment, perform actions with their body, senses, mind, and intellect, only for the purpose of self-purification."
Bhagavad Gita 5.12
"Offering the results of all activities to God, the karm yogis attain everlasting peace. Whereas those who, being impelled by their desires, work with a selfish motive become entangled because they are attached to the fruits of their actions."
Bhagavad Gita 5.13
The embodied beings who are self-controlled and detached reside happily in the city of nine gates free from thoughts that they are the doers or the cause of anything.
Bhagavad Gita 5.14
Neither the sense of doership nor the nature of actions comes from God; nor does He create the fruits of actions. All this is enacted by the modes of material nature (gu?as).
Bhagavad Gita 5.15
The omnipresent God does not involve Himself in the sinful or virtuous deeds of anyone. The living entities are deluded because their inner knowledge is covered by ignorance.
Bhagavad Gita 5.16
"But for those whose ignorance is destroyed by divine knowledge, the Supreme Entity is revealed, just as the sun illumines everything when it rises."
Bhagavad Gita 5.17
"Those whose intellect is fixed in God, who are completely absorbed in God, with firm faith in Him as the supreme goal, such persons quickly reach the state from which there is no return, their sins having been dispelled by the light of knowledge."
Bhagavad Gita 5.18
"The truly learned, with the eyes of divine knowledge, see with equal vision a Brahmin, a cow, an elephant, a dog, and a dog-eater."
Bhagavad Gita 5.19
"Those whose minds are established in equality of vision conquer the cycle of birth and death in this very life. They possess the flawless qualities of God, and are therefore seated in the Absolute Truth."
Bhagavad Gita 5.20
"Established in God, having a firm understanding of divine knowledge and not hampered by delusion, they neither rejoice in getting something pleasant nor grieve on experiencing the unpleasant."
Bhagavad Gita 5.21
"Those who are not attached to external sense pleasures realize divine bliss in the self. Being united with God through Yog, they experience unending happiness."
Bhagavad Gita 5.22
"The pleasures that arise from contact with the sense objects, though appearing as enjoyable to worldly-minded people, are verily a source of misery. O son of Kunti, such pleasures have a beginning and an end, so the wise do not delight in them."
Bhagavad Gita 5.23
"Those persons are yogis, who before giving up the body are able to check the forces of desire and anger; and they alone are happy."
Bhagavad Gita 5.24
"Those who are happy within themselves, enjoying the delight of God within, and are illumined by the inner light, such yogis are united with the Lord and are liberated from material existence."

Bhagavad Gita 5.27 – 5.28
"Shutting out all thoughts of external enjoyment, with the gaze fixed on the space between the eye-brows, equalizing the flow of the incoming and outgoing breath in the nostrils, and thus controlling the senses, mind, and intellect, the sage who becomes free from desire and fear, always lives in freedom."
Bhagavad Gita 5.29

"What is known as sany?s is non-different from Yog, for none become yogis without renouncing worldly desires."

Bhagavad Gita 6.5
"Elevate yourself through the power of your mind, and not degrade yourself, for the mind can be the friend and also the enemy of the self."
Bhagavad Gita 6.6
"For those who have conquered the mind, it is their friend. For those who have failed to do so, the mind works like an enemy."

"The yogis who have conquered the mind rise above the dualities of cold and heat, joy and sorrow, and honor and dishonor. Such yogis remain peaceful and steadfast in their devotion to God."

Bhagavad Gita 6.9
"The yogis look upon all—well-wishers, friends, foes, the pious, and the sinners—with an impartial intellect. The yogi who is of equal intellect toward friend, companion, and foe, neutral among enemies and relatives, and unbiased between the righteous and sinful, is considered to be distinguished among humans."
Bhagavad Gita 6.10
"Those who seek the state of Yog should reside in seclusion, constantly engaged in meditation with a controlled mind and body, getting rid of desires and possessions for enjoyment."
Bhagavad Gita 6.11
"To practice Yog, one should make an ?san (seat) in a sanctified place, by placing Ku?h grass, deer skin, and a cloth, one over the other. The ?san should be neither too high nor too low."
Bhagavad Gita 6.12 – 6.13
"Seated firmly on it, the yogi should strive to purify the mind by focusing it in meditation with one pointed concentration, controlling all thoughts and activities. He must hold the body, neck, and head firmly in a straight line, and gaze at the tip of the nose, without allowing the eyes to wander."
Bhagavad Gita 6.14
"Thus, with a serene, fearless, and unwavering mind, and staunch in the vow of celibacy, the vigilant yogi should meditate on Me, having Me alone as the supreme goal."
Bhagavad Gita 6.15
"Thus, constantly keeping the mind absorbed in Me, the yogi of disciplined mind attains nirv??, and abides in Me in supreme peace."
Bhagavad Gita 6.16
"O Arjun, those who eat too much or too little, sleep too much or too little, cannot attain success in Yog."
Bhagavad Gita 6.17
"But those who are temperate in eating and recreation, balanced in work, and regulated in sleep, can mitigate all sorrows by practicing Yog."

"Having gained that state, one does not consider any attainment to be greater. Being thus established, one is not shaken even in the midst of the greatest calamity."
Bhagavad Gita 6.23
That state of severance from union with misery is known as Yog. This Yog should be resolutely practiced with determination free from pessimism.
Bhagavad Gita 6.24 – 6.25
"Completely renouncing all desires arising from thoughts of the world, one should restrain the senses from all sides with the mind. Slowly and steadily, with conviction in the intellect, the mind will become fixed in God alone, and will think of nothing else."
Bhagavad Gita 6.26
"Whenever and wherever the restless and unsteady mind wanders, one should bring it back and continually focus it on God."

Bhagavad Gita 6.40
"The Supreme Lord said: O Parth, one who engages on the spiritual path does not meet with destruction either in this world or the world to come. My dear friend, one who strives for God-realization is never overcome by evil."
Bhagavad Gita 6.41 – 6.42
"The unsuccessful yogis, upon death, go to the abodes of the virtuous. After dwelling there for many ages, they are again reborn in the earth plane, into a family of pious and prosperous people. Else, if they had developed dispassion due to long practice of Yog, they are born into a family endowed with divine wisdom. Such a birth is very difficult to attain in this world."
Bhagavad Gita 6.43
"On taking such a birth, O descendant of Kurus, they reawaken the wisdom of their previous lives, and strive even harder toward perfection in Yog."
Bhagavad Gita 6.44
"Indeed, they feel drawn toward God, even against their will, on the strength of their past discipline. Such seekers naturally rise above the ritualistic principles of the scriptures."

Bhagavad Gita 6.46

The practitioners of Vedic rituals, who pass away during the six months of the sun’s southern course, the dark fortnight of the moon, the time of smoke, the night, attain the celestial abodes. After enjoying celestial pleasures, they again return to the earth. These two, bright and dark paths, always exist in this world. The way of light leads to liberation and the way of darkness leads to rebirth."

"Listen and I will explain to you what that field is and what its nature is. I will also explain how change takes place within it, from what it was created, who the knower of the field of activities is, and what his powers are."
Bhagavad Gita 13.5
"Great sages have sung the truth about the field and the knower of the field in manifold ways. It has been stated in various Vedic hymns, and especially revealed in the Brahma S?tra, with sound logic and conclusive evidence."
Bhagavad Gita 13.6
"The field of activities is composed of the five great elements, the ego, the intellect, the unmanifest primordial matter, the eleven senses (five knowledge senses, five working senses, and mind), and the five objects of the senses."
Bhagavad Gita 13.7
"Desire and aversion, happiness and misery, the body, consciousness, and the will—all these comprise the field and its modifications."
Bhagavad Gita 13.8 – 13.12
"Humbleness; freedom from hypocrisy; non-violence; forgiveness; simplicity; service of the Guru; cleanliness of body and mind; steadfastness; and self-control; dispassion toward the objects of the senses; absence of egotism; keeping in mind the evils of birth, disease, old age, and death; non-attachment; absence of clinging to spouse, children, home, and so on; even-mindedness amidst desired and undesired events in life; constant and exclusive devotion toward Me; an inclination for solitary places and an aversion for mundane society; constancy in spiritual knowledge; and philosophical pursuit of the Absolute Truth—all these I declare to be knowledge, and what is contrary to it, I call ignorance."
Bhagavad Gita 13.13
"I shall now reveal to you that which ought to be known, and by knowing which, one attains immortality. It is the beginningless Brahman, which lies beyond existence and non-existence."
Bhagavad Gita 13.14
"Everywhere are His hands and feet, eyes, heads, and faces. His ears too are in all places, for He pervades everything in the universe."
Bhagavad Gita 13.15
"Though He perceives all sense-objects, yet He is devoid of the senses. He is unattached to everything, and yet He is the sustainer of all. Although He is without attributes, yet He is the enjoyer of the three modes of material nature."
Bhagavad Gita 13.16
"He exists outside and inside all living beings, those that are moving and not moving. He is subtle, and hence, He is incomprehensible. He is very far, but He is also very near."
Bhagavad Gita 13.17
"He is indivisible, yet He appears to be divided amongst living beings. Know the Supreme Entity to be the Sustainer, Annihilator, and Creator of all beings."
Bhagavad Gita 13.18
"He is the source of light in all luminaries, and is entirely beyond the darkness of ignorance. He is knowledge, the object of knowledge, and the goal of knowledge. He dwells within the hearts of all living beings."
Bhagavad Gita 13.19
"I have thus revealed to you the nature of the field, the meaning of knowledge, and the object of knowledge. Only My devotees can understand this in reality, and by doing so, they attain My divine nature."
Bhagavad Gita 13.20
Know that prak?iti (material nature) and puru?h (the individual souls) are both beginningless. Also know that all transformations of the body and the three modes of nature are produced by material energy.
Bhagavad Gita 13.21
"In the matter of creation, the material energy is responsible for cause and effect; in the matter of experiencing happiness and distress, the individual soul is declared responsible."
Bhagavad Gita 13.22
"When the puru?h (individual soul) seated in prak?iti (the material energy) desires to enjoy the three gu?as, attachment to them becomes the cause of its birth in superior and inferior wombs."
Bhagavad Gita 13.23
"Within the body also resides the Supreme Lord. He is said to be the Witness, the Permitter, the Supporter, Transcendental Enjoyer, the ultimate Controller, and the Param?tm? (Supreme Soul)."
Bhagavad Gita 13.24
"Those who understand the truth about Supreme Soul, the individual soul, material nature, and the interaction of the three modes of nature will not take birth here again. They will be liberated regardless of their present condition."
Bhagavad Gita 13.25
"Some try to perceive the Supreme Soul within their hearts through meditation, and others try to do so through the cultivation of knowledge, while still others strive to attain that realization by the path of action."
Bhagavad Gita 13.26
"There are still others who are unaware of these spiritual paths, but they hear from others and begin worshipping the Supreme Lord. By such devotion to hearing from saints, they too can gradually cross over the ocean of birth and death."
Bhagavad Gita 13.27
"O best of the Bharatas, whatever moving or unmoving being you see in existence, know it to be a combination of the field of activities and the knower of the field."
Bhagavad Gita 13.28
"They alone truly see, who perceive the Param?tm? (Supreme Soul) accompanying the soul in all beings, and who understand both to be imperishable in this perishable body."
Bhagavad Gita 13.29
"Those, who see God as the Supreme Soul equally present everywhere and in all living beings, do not degrade themselves by their mind. Thereby, they reach the supreme destination."
Bhagavad Gita 13.30
"They alone truly see who understand that all actions (of the body) are performed by material nature, while the embodied soul actually does nothing."
Bhagavad Gita 13.31
"When they see the diverse variety of living beings situated in the same material nature, and understand all of them to be born from it, they attain the realization of the Brahman."
Bhagavad Gita 13.32
"The Supreme Soul is imperishable, without beginning, and devoid of any material qualities, O son of Kunti. Although situated within the body, It neither acts, nor is It tainted by material energy."
Bhagavad Gita 13.33
"Space holds everything within it, but being subtle, does not get contaminated by what it holds. Similarly, though its consciousness pervades the body, the soul is not affected by the attributes of the body."
Bhagavad Gita 13.34
"Just as one sun illumines the entire solar system, so does the individual soul illumine the entire body (with consciousness)."
Bhagavad Gita 13.35
"Those who perceive with the eyes of knowledge the difference between the body and the knower of the body, and the process of release from material nature, attain the supreme destination"

"The Divine Lord said: I shall once again explain to you the supreme wisdom, the best of all knowledge; by knowing which, all the great saints attained the highest perfection."
Bhagavad Gita 14.2
Those who take refuge in this wisdom will be united with Me. They will not be reborn at the time of creation nor destroyed at the time of dissolution.
Bhagavad Gita 14.3 – 14.4
"The total material substance, prak?iti, is the womb. I impregnate it with the individual souls, and thus all living beings are born. O son of Kunti, for all species of life that are produced, the material nature is the womb, and I am the seed-giving Father."
Bhagavad Gita 14.5
"O mighty-armed Arjun, the material energy consists of three gu?as (modes)—sattva (goodness), rajas (passion), and tamas (ignorance). These modes bind the eternal soul to the perishable body."
Bhagavad Gita 14.6
"Amongst these, sattva gu?a, the mode of goodness, being purer than the others, is illuminating and full of well-being. O sinless one, it binds the soul by creating attachment for a sense of happiness and knowledge."
Bhagavad Gita 14.7
"O Arjun, rajo gu?a is of the nature of passion. It arises from worldly desires and affections, and binds the soul through attachment to fruitive actions."
Bhagavad Gita 14.8
"O Arjun, tamo gu?a, which is born of ignorance, is the cause of illusion for the embodied souls. It deludes all living beings through negligence, laziness, and sleep."
Bhagavad Gita 14.9
Sattva binds one to material happiness; rajas conditions the soul toward actions; and tamas clouds wisdom and binds one to delusion.
Bhagavad Gita 14.10
"Sometimes goodness (sattva) prevails over passion (rajas) and ignorance (tamas), O scion of Bharat. Sometimes passion (rajas) dominates goodness (sattva) and ignorance (tamas), and at other times ignorance (tamas) overcomes goodness (sattva) and passion (rajas)."
Bhagavad Gita 14.11 – 14.13
"When all the gates of the body are illumined by knowledge, know it to be a manifestation of the mode of goodness. When the mode of passion predominates, O Arjun, the symptoms of greed, exertion for worldly gain, restlessness, and craving develop. O Arjun, nescience, inertia, negligence, and delusion—these are the dominant signs of the mode of ignorance."
Bhagavad Gita 14.14 – 14.15
"Those who die with predominance of sattva reach the pure abodes (which are free from rajas and tamas) of the learned. Those who die with prevalence of the mode of passion are born among people driven by work, while those dying in the mode of ignorance take birth in the animal kingdom."
Bhagavad Gita 14.16
"It is said the fruit of actions performed in the mode of goodness bestow pure results. Actions done in the mode of passion result in pain, while those performed in the mode of ignorance result in darkness."
Bhagavad Gita 14.17
"From the mode of goodness arises knowledge, from the mode of passion arises greed, and from the mode of ignorance arise negligence and delusion."
Bhagavad Gita 14.18
Those situated in the mode of goodness rise upward; those in the mode of passion stay in the middle; and those in the mode of ignorance go downward.
Bhagavad Gita 14.19
"When wise persons see that in all work there is no agent of action other than the three gu?as, and they know Me to be transcendental to these gu?as, they attain My divine nature."
Bhagavad Gita 14.20
"By transcending the three modes of material nature associated with the body, one becomes free from birth, death, old age, and misery, and attains immortality."
Bhagavad Gita 14.21
"Arjun inquired: What are the characteristics of those who have gone beyond the three gu?as, O Lord? How do they act? How do they go beyond the bondage of the gu?as?"
Bhagavad Gita 14.22 – 14.23
"The Supreme Divine Personality said: O Arjun, The persons who are transcendental to the three gu?as neither hate illumination (which is born of sattva), nor activity (which is born of rajas), nor even delusion (which is born of tamas), when these are abundantly present, nor do they long for them when they are absent. They remain neutral to the modes of nature and are not disturbed by them. Knowing it is only the gu?as that act, they stay established in the self, without wavering."
Bhagavad Gita 14.24 – 14.25
"Those who are alike in happiness and distress; who are established in the self; who look upon a clod, a stone, and a piece of gold as of equal value; who remain the same amidst pleasant and unpleasant events; who are intelligent; who accept both blame and praise with equanimity; who remain the same in honor and dishonor; who treat both friend and foe alike; and who have abandoned all enterprises – they are said to have risen above the three gu?as."
Bhagavad Gita 14.26
Those who serve Me with unalloyed devotion rise above the three modes of material nature and come to the level of the Brahman.
Bhagavad Gita 14.27
"I am the basis of the formless Brahman, the immortal and imperishable, of eternal dharma, and of unending divine bliss."
Bhagavad Gita 15.1
"The Supreme Divine Personality said: They speak of an eternal a?hvatth tree with its roots above and branches below. Its leaves are the Vedic hymns, and one who knows the secret of this tree is the knower of the Vedas."
Bhagavad Gita 15.2
"The branches of the tree extend upward and downward, nourished by the three gu?as, with the objects of the senses as tender buds. The roots of the tree hang downward, causing the flow of karma in the human form. Below, its roots branch out causing (karmic) actions in the world of humans."
Bhagavad Gita 15.3 – 15.4
"The real form of this tree is not perceived in this world, neither its beginning nor end, nor its continued existence. But this deep-rooted a?hvatth tree must be cut down with a strong axe of detachment. Then one must search out the base of the tree, which is the Supreme Lord, from whom streamed forth the activity of the universe a long time ago. Upon taking refuge in Him, one will not return to this world again."
Bhagavad Gita 15.5
"Those who are free from vanity and delusion, who have overcome the evil of attachment, who dwell constantly on the self and on God, who are free from the desire to enjoy the senses, and are beyond the dualities of pleasure and pain, such liberated personalities attain My eternal Abode."
Bhagavad Gita 15.6
"Neither the sun nor the moon, nor fire can illumine that Supreme Abode of Mine. Having gone There, one does not return to this material world again."
Bhagavad Gita 15.7
"The embodied souls in this material world are My eternal fragmental parts. But bound by material nature, they are struggling with the six senses including the mind."
Bhagavad Gita 15.8
"As the air carries fragrance from place to place, so does the embodied soul carry the mind and senses with it, when it leaves an old body and enters a new one."
Bhagavad Gita 15.9
"Using the sense perceptions of the ears, eyes, skin, tongue, and nose, which are grouped around the mind, the embodied soul savors the objects of the senses."
Bhagavad Gita 15.10
"The ignorant do not perceive the soul as it resides in the body, and as it enjoys sense objects; nor do they perceive it when it departs. But those who possess the eyes of knowledge can behold it."
Bhagavad Gita 15.11
"Striving yogis too are able to realize the soul enshrined in the body. However, those whose minds are not purified cannot cognize it, even though they strive to do so."

Know that I am like the brilliance of the sun that illuminates the entire solar system. The radiance of the moon and the brightness of the fire also come from Me.

Bhagavad Gita 15.16
"There are two kinds of beings in creation, the k?har (perishable) and the ak?har (imperishable). The perishable are all beings in the material realm. The imperishable are the the liberated beings."

That enemy has been destroyed by me, and I shall destroy the others too! I am like God Himself, I am the enjoyer, I am perfect, I am powerful, and I am happy. I am wealthy and I have highly placed relatives. Who else is equal to me? I shall perform sacrifices (to the celestial gods); I shall give alms; I shall rejoice.” In this way, they are deluded by ignorance."

Bhagavad Gita 18.7

"When actions are undertaken in response to duty, and one relinquishes attachment to any reward, O Arjun, it is considered renunciation in the nature of goodness."

Bhagavad Gita 18.15 – 18.16

Bhagavad Gita 18.17
"Those who are free from the ego of being the doer, and whose intellect is unattached, though they may slay living beings, they neither kill nor are they bound by actions."

Bhagavad Gita 18.20
Understand that knowledge to be in the mode of goodness by which a person sees one undivided imperishable reality within all diverse living beings.
