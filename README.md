# *vaani* <br>

A repository for a Design Thinking and Innovation course at Bennett University 2022-2023. Created by Team number 3 as part of the course, by members Vasu Jain, Anand Chauhan, Amee Madhani and Ananya Chauhan. The entire project was in development since January 2023 for a period of 4 months.

## About

<p align="justify">
vaani is a religious text generator. The project's purpose is to extract relevant verses and quotes from religious texts by factoring the user's input as a problem to be resolved or given advice about. This is part of a general push of our interesting into seeing how AI handles abstraction, religion and semantics on said abstractions. </p>
